# Pull request strategies

- In Azure repo's you can have **limit merge types** branch policy
  - Standardizes a strategy for the whole team

## Merge (no fast-forward)

- Standard strategy in Azure repos & most other Git providers
- It emulates running `git merge pr` from the master branch
- All the individual commits in the pull request branch are preserved as-is,
  - and a new merge commit is created to unite the master branch and the pull request branch.

- Trade-off:
  - Pros
    - It gives the most insight into how a branch evolves
    - Illustrates exactly how a developer (or developers) worked on a pull request
  - Cons: since it preserves every commit is may be very verbose.

## Squash commit

- Creates a single new commit
  - leads to a just a simple, straight, linear history
- Emulates running `git merge pr --squash` from the master branch.
- The resulting commit is not a merge commit; those individual commits that made up the pull request are discarded.

- ðŸ’¡ As individual commits are lost, it's best for teams that use "fix up" commits or do not carefully craft individual commits for review before pushing them.

## Rebase

- Takes each individual commit in the pull request and cherry-pick them onto the master branch.
- Emulates running
  1. `git rebase` master on the pull request branch
  2. `git merge pr --ff-only` on the master branch.

- History is straight and linear, like it is with the "squash" option but each individual commit is retained
- ðŸ’¡ Useful for teams that practice careful commit hygiene, where each individual commit stands on its own.

## Semi-linear merge

- Also known as "rebase and merge"
  - The commits in the pull request are rebased on top of the master branch
  - Then rebased pull requests are merged into master branch
- Emulates running
  1. `git rebase master` on the pull request branch
  2. `git merge pr --no-ff` on the master branch
- ![git semi-linear merge](./img/pull-request-strategies/semi-linear-merge.gif)
- ðŸ’¡ Some see it as best of both worlds
  - individual commits are retained, so that you can see how the work evolved
  - but instead of just being rebased, a "merge bubble" is shown so that you can immediately see the work in each individual pull request.
