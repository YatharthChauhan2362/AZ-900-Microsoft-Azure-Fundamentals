# SonarQube

- Open-source code Analysis tool, [sonarqube.org](https://sonarqube.org)
- Helps you to see your projects technical debt
- Detect bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, coverage...

## SonarQube & Azure Repos

- See [labs](https://azuredevopslabs.com/labs/vstsextend/sonarcloud/)
- 📝 Steps:
  - *(If you don't have SonarQube)* Create VM with container & SonarQube image
    - Ensure port 8080 is open on VM/container to be able to comunicate with Azure DevOps
  1. Create a project in SonarQube
     - It'll give you authentication token you'll need (you can also use an existing token)
     - Also gives you scripts to run for different languages/frameworks
     - You'll use name of this project in service connection.
  2. You create **service connection** for SonarQube.
     - You can use token from SonarQube project or generate a new token in security section of SonarQube
  3. In organization settings add SonarQube **extension**
     - Gives you tasks to execute in [following order](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-azure-devops/):
     1. Prepare Analysis Configuration
        - Before executing the build
     2. Run Code Analysis
        - Not required for Maven or Gradle projects, because scanner will be run as part of the Maven/Gradle build.
     3. Publish Quality Gate Result
        - Optional to display the Quality Gate status in the build summary
  4. You can analyze results in SonarQube server
- Set-up a pull-request integration:
  1. Create a Personal Access Token in Azure DevOps
  2. Configure SonarCloud to analyze pull requests
     - In Pull Requests tab set provider to Azure DevOps Services
  3. Configure the branch policy for the project in Azure DevOps
     - Set SonarQube pipeline as build definition
  4. Block pull requests if the Code Quality check failed
     - Branch Policy => Add status policy => SonarCloud/quality gate and mark requirement as Required
- [Tasks to run](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-azure-devops/):
  - Prepare Analysis Configuration
  - Run Code Analysis (not required)
