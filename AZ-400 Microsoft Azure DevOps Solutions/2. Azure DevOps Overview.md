# Azure DevOps Overview

## Interacting with Azure DevOps

### Azure CLI

- You can use [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) with the [Azure DevOps extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devops-cli-extension) to work with Azure DevOps
  - Enables automate everything as you can script anything and hook it in a build pipeline.
- Run on Linux, macOS or Windows
- Accessible via browser using Azure Cloud Shell
- It structures as group, sub group and commands
  - `az –help`: display all groups, sub groups and commands
    - e.g. `vm` is sub group of `az` so you can run `az vm -help` too
  - Find command: `az find -q MyCommand`

### Azure PowerShell

- PowerShell providing services like Shell and Command parsing
- Base PowerShell has 2 format:
  - Windows PowerShell
  - PowerShell core (Cross platform, Linux and macOS)
- Cmdlets are shipped in modules
  - Module is a .DLL that include the code for Cmdlet
  - Cmdlet is loaded by loading all its modules
  - `Get-Module` to get list of all loaded modules.
- Azure PowerShell is a PowerShell module that can be added to Windows PowerShell & PowerShell core
  - Accessible via browser using Azure Cloud Shell
- 💡 Can store templates or scripts on Azure Storage account and securing them with SAS token

## Azure DevOps tool landscape

- **Azure Boards**
  - Agile tools that support planning and tracking work items
- **Azure Test Plans**
  - Tools for testing your applications

## Service hooks

- Trigger tasks in external services from Azure DevOps
  - E.g. if code is pushed => create a new card in Trello or just call a webhook
- You can integrate with (see updated list in [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/service-hooks/overview?view=azure-devops))
  - Build and release: AppVeyor [1], Bamboo [2], Jenkins [3], MyGet [4], Slack [5] .
  - Collaborate: FlowDock [6], HuBot, Office [8] .
  - Customer support: UserVoice [9], ZenDesk [10] .
  - Plan and track: Trello [11] .
  - Integrate: Service Bus [12], Azure Storage [13], Grafana [14], Web Hooks [15], Zapier [16] .
