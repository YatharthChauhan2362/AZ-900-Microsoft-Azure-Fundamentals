# Test and Work Management Tools

- Decide tools that works best for **you**
- Ask questions:
  - What sort of testing do you perform?
    - E.g. unit testing, system testing, volume testing, system testing
    - See [test tools](#test-tools) and [test coverage tools](#test-coverage-tools)
  - Do you perform static code analysis?
    - Do developers use tools where errors are highlighted?
  - Do you perform dynamic code analysis?
    - Tests on runtime
  - Do you posses any test frameworks?
  - Do you test your code against security vulnerabilities?
    - Most common by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)
    - See [security tools](8.%20DevSecOps.md#security-tools)
  - What languages do your company use? E.g. .NET, java, python
    - Tools will change based on the support for the underlying programming language
  - Do you use any performance testing tools?
    - See [test tools](#test-tools)
  - Do you use any work management tools?
    - E.g. change management, configuration management and release management
