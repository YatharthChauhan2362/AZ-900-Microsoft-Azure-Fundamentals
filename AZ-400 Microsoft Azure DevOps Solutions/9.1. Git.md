# Using git

- You can use [git CLI](#git-cli)
- You can also use other tools such as Visual Studio (through Team Explorer)
  - Connect directly to Azure DevOps with your Microsoft account to work with Azure Repos.

## Git CLI

- Create a repository
  1. Download `git`
  2. run `git init` on a folder where you'll want to have your repository
     - You get `master` branch ready
     - `HEAD` shows the current branch in start it's `master`
  3. Create a file called `filename.txt`
  4. Run `git add filename.txt` or `git add .` (for all files in the folder)
  5. Commit your changes with a message `git commit -m "first commit"`
- Useful commands
  - `git log`: to show all commits
    - Each commit has `SHA` hash you can see here.
    - You can revert a commit using `git revert commit-sha` (or first 3 chars of the `sha`)
  - `git fetch`: to download remote-tracking branches
  - `git pull`: does `git fetch` followed by a `git merge FETCH_HEAD` to update your files to latest in remote.

## Branching

- Working with multiple developers -> Changing master branch is not good.
  - Some changes may not be complete or working as it should.
  - Making changes to `master` branch itself can make other developers get incorrect or non-working code.
- Instead create another branch from `master` and each developer work on their own branches
  - Main master branch remains intact with working code.
  - You can create multiple branches
  - Branches are lightweight
  - Copies of your code are not made.
  - E.g. separate branch for each bug fix / feature.
- In git:
  - Run `git status` to see the base you're currently working from
  - Create new branch using `git branch <branch-name>`
  - Switch to the new branch using `git checkout <branch-name>`
  - At any point, when you want to merge your changes, you can run `git merge`
    - First you need to be on master `git checkout master`
    - Then you run `git merge feature-branch`

### Branching Workflows

- **Long-Running Branches**
  - e.g entirely stable in their `master` branch
- **Topic branches**
  - Short-lived branches for particular feature / work
  - There are usually multiple topic branches
- **Progressive-stability branching**
  - Long-running stable `master`
  - Another parallel branch named `develop` or `next` to test stability
  - It isn't necessarily always stable, but whenever it gets to a stable state, it can be merged into `master`
  - Used to pull in topic branches & test so they don't introduce bugs.

#### Centralized Workflow

- There's only one branch `master` and everyone commits to `master`
- Good for teams transitioning from SVN.
- See also [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)

#### Feature Branch Workflow

- All feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the `master` branch.
- Logical extension of [Centralized Workflow](#centralized-workflow).
- Cons:
  - Easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase.
  - `master` branch should never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments.
  - Enables PR's

#### Gitflow Workflow

- Strict branching model designed around the project release
- Based on [Feature Branch Workflow](#feature-branch-workflow)
- Development:
  - Feature branches are branched off of the `develop` branch
  - Finished features and fixes are merged back into the `develop` branch
- Releasing:
  - When it is time to make a release, a release branch is created off of `develop`.
  - When the release is finished, the release branch is merged into `master` and into `develop` too
- ðŸ¤— See [Gitflow animation](https://github.com/vraa/gitflowanimated/)
- ðŸ¤— The Gitflow Workflow was first published in a highly regarded 2010 blog post from [Vincent Driessen at nvie](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

#### Release-flow

- Based on [feature branch workflow](#feature-branch-workflow)
- [Enforced in Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/release-flow)
- Development:
  1. Dev creates a new branch off of our main integration
     - ðŸ’¡ Use feature flags to have short-lived branches
  2. Devs push their local branch to a branch on the server, and open a pull request
  3. When tests are passed, changes are merged into `master`
- Releases:
  - Releases always result in a tag of the repository
  - A release tag should use a three segment number as defined in [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
  - If a release branch is necessary `release/1.1.x` is created.

#### Forking Workflow

- Each contributor two Git repositories
  - a private local one and a public server-side one.
- E.g. GitHub

## Cloning

- Once the code is in a shared repository, a developer can clone the repository
- They can then create a branch out of the current master branch
- They then make changes on their branch

### Forking

- Copy of the entire repository
- Commits do not go against the original repository
- Use-cases:
  - Main repository might have issues, so clean new repository is forked for making changes
  - Building application for multiple clients and each client has client-specific features

## Pull requests

- A dev has cloned a repo > created a new branch > made changes > commited to branch > pushed branch to remote repo > wants to merge the branch into the branch.
- Developer initiates a pull-requests
  - If there are conflicts between main & uploaded branch
  - They need to be resolved
  - Approval needs to be put into place for the pull request
