# Deployment Patterns

## Feature toggles

- [Feature toggles](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html) are booleans in code that activates or deactivates a feature in run-time
- You can deploy first
  - Measure soundness of your release in backwards compatibility/bug perspective
  - Release new functionality gradually to different users, or vice versa (scale down or even rollback functionality and/or binaries).
  - Allows for splitting availability of functionality from deployment of binaries, and gives much more fine-grained decision making then only "deploy/rollback"
- ðŸ’¡ Always using it a good way to increase your confidence in a new version, since the new version functions exactly like the old until someone flips a feature toggle.

## Blue Green deployments

- The essence of blue-green is deploying all at once
- Easy rollbacks in case of failure.
- Completely automated deployment process
- Zero downtime deployment
- Concept
  - Blue version = Current version, users use it
  - Green version = New version on production, not yet available
  - You redirect users to Green release and at the end it becomes your Blue release.
- Azure Traffic Manager [allows it](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/blue-green-deployments-using-azure-traffic-manager/) with its [weighted](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-routing-methods#weighted) round-robin routing method

## Canary Deployments

- The essence of canary deployment is deploying incrementally
- Deploys in small, incremental steps, and only to a small group of people
- It is about to get an idea of how new version will perform (integrate with other apps, CPU, memory, disk usage, etc).

## Rolling deployment

- Slowly replaces currently running instances of the application with newer ones.
- Noting that the old one is removed only when the new is has passed health checks is important
