# Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery

## Continuous Integration

- Automation for entire application lifecycle.
- Allows you to detect issues & bugs early on in development lifecycle
  - It takes more time for issues to resolved when they are detected too late
  - Re-testing needs to be carried out.
  - Solution:
    - Run tests as soon as developer makes a commit to repository
    - Based on a schedule that runs e.g. every day
- E.g.
  - Commit *->* Version control *--triggers-->* build *---triggers-->* deployed to a test environment *--triggers-->* test cases are automated *--triggered-->* final results *->* build is marked as success or failure
- Tools are important e.g. Jenkins, Atlassian Bamboo, TeamCity, Azure Pipelines
- Multi-configuration builds
  - e.g. build app for both debug and release configurations on both x86 and x64 platforms.

## Continuous Delivery

- Compliments your continuous integration process.
- Automates deployment of your changes after build.
- Track of your release process quality
  - Visualizations about the quality of all the releases pipeline. e.g. adding a dashboard widget which shows the status of every release.
- Release Notes, functional and technical documentation
  - Generate Release Notes Build Task (VSTS)
  - WIKI Updater Tasks (VSTS)
  - 💡 Treat release documentation & manuals as source-code
    - When the product changes, the documentation needs to change as well
- Multi-configuration deployments
  - e.g. for different geographic regions.

### Feature Flags

- Allows you to separate your functional release from your technical release
- Decide to have a feature on runtime; enable/disable a feature based on a boolean

### Deployment rings

- Gradually deploying and validating changes in production
- Impact
  - Also called **blast radius**
  - evaluated through observation, testing, analysis of telemetry, and user feedback
- E.g.:
  - **Canaries*** who voluntarily test bleeding edge features as soon as they are available.
  - **Early adopter*** who voluntarily preview releases, considered more refined than the canary bits.
  - **Users** who consume the products, after passing through canaries and early adopters.

### Web App Deployment

- **Deployment slots**
  - Allows you to create a new deployment for the web app.
  - ❗ Requires **Standard** or higher plan to be able to use deployment slots.
  - App content and configurations elements can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot.
  - Use-cases:
    - Create staging environment easily in Web Apps
      - Validate in staging before swapping to production
    - You can apply Blue Green deployments
    - Zero downtime deployment with a **auto swap**
      - Allows you to ensure that all instances of the slot are warmed up before being swapped into production
      - Click on slot => App settings => Auto swap: on
