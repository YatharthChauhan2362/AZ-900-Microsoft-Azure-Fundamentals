# Azure DevOps - Test Plans

- View test cases, runs & results.
- **Test suites**: Groups test cases together for e.g. different scenarios.
- **Test plans**: Groups test suites and test cases.

## Test cases

- Each work item in Azure Boards can have multiple test cases.
  - Create by clicking on  *Add test*
- Each test case consists of multiple steps
  - Each step has an Action, Expected result, and Attachments.
- You can assign the test cases to individual testers
- Run test cases manually
  - In test plan view you can run your tests one by one.
    - You can comment & add screenshots/recording/user actions and create issues & bugs easily.
  - Or you can as passed or failed on directly on Azure Boards
- [Run automated test cases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/run-automated-tests-from-test-hub?view=azure-devops)
  - You can couple test-cases with pipelines and run them automatically through Test

## Load Tests

- See how well your application can behave under certain types of load or stress.
- Types
  - You can create URL based load tests
  - Import tests from tools such as Visual Studio or Apache JMeter.
  - Run HTTP-archive based tests
    - Record HTTP sessions.
    - Tests from Fiddler can be important this way
- You can set:
  - Load pattern that can be:
    - Constant: Same amount of users
    - Step: Set amount of initial users `x`, after period of `y` seconds, increment number of users by `z`.
  - Set time duration,  maximum amount of users, initial user count, warmup duration, and which browsers to mimic.
  - Select user agents:
    - Automatically provisioned: You can select the geo-location
    - Your own provisioned agents
- After execution you get summary, charts (performance, throughput, errors, tests), diagnostics and logs.
