- Tool for continuous integration & delivery, see [jenkins.io](https://jenkins.io)
- Multi-OS & open-source
- Supports many languages with rich set of plugins
- You can use webhooks for auto-trigger from GitHub

## Jenkins & Azure Repos

- To enable Jenkins to fetch from Azure Repos ([see lab](https://www.azuredevopslabs.com/labs/vstsextend/Jenkins/)):
  - Steps:
    - Create a ***personal access token*** in Azure DevOps with read access & add it in Jenkins
    - Install [***TFS plugin***](https://github.com/jenkinsci/tfs-plugin) (yet to be renamed Azure DevOps!) to Jenkins to allow:
      - TFVC: Poll & read & label
      - Git: Push trigger, build information fetching
  - For auto trigger from Azure Repos:
    - Create [***service hook***](./2.%20Azure%20DevOps%20Overview.md#service-hooks) in Azure repos to trigger Jenkins build ([official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/service-hooks/services/jenkins?view=azure-devops))
  - To nest a Jenkins Job with Azure Pipelines
    - Add a ***service connection*** to Jenkins.
    - You can use Jenkin tasks such as *Queue Jenkins Job*, *Download artifacts* ...
    - ðŸ’¡ Recommended as you can have end-to-end traceability from work items to source code to build and release pipelines.
