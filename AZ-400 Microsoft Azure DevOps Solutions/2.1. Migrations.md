# Azure DevOps Migrations

## Migrating code

- TFVC to Git
  - Using web portal by clicking import repository (180 days history & less complex)
  - Using `git-tfs` command line tool (more than 180 and complex)
    - `git tfs clone https://tfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection $/Project1`
- Git to Git
  - Using web portal by clicking import repository
  - Using git mirror

## Migrating from on-prem TFS/Azure DevOps to Azure DevOps Services

- You can migrate easily to Azure DevOps services from on-prem TFS / Azure DevOps Server
  - Using the ***data migration tool*** (formerly ***Database Import Service for Visual Studio Team Services***).
  - ðŸ’¡ Team Foundation Server (TFS) became Azure DevOps Server with the 2019 release of the on-premises product
- Summary of [Azure DevOps Server to Azure DevOps Services Migration Guide and tool](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/migrate/?cdn=disable).
  - **Prerequisites**
    - Ensure your team has active Azure Active Directory
    - You can implement Azure Active Directory to synchronize with your on-premises Active Directory environment.
      - Use ***Azure AD Connect***
    - Good to enable ***MFA*** for access from unknown places using ***Conditional Access***
  - **Steps**
    1. Upgrade TFS
       1. Upgrade your Azure DevOps Server or Team Foundation Server
          - It's to get DB scheme as close to the current in Azure DevOps Service
       2. Run "Configuration Features" to enable new features
    2. Validate Your TFS Server
       1. Run validations with migration tool
       2. Review logs and fix errors
       3. Repeat validation checks
    3. Get Ready for Import
       1. Assign, activate, and map Azure DevOps Services subscriptions
       2. Generate import settings using `Migrator prepare` command
       3. Provide the configurable settings
       4. Review the Identity Map log file
       5. Create an Azure Storage Container in the same datacenter as the final Azure DevOps Services organization.
    4. Import
       1. Dry run of end-to-end import
       2. Detach the team project collection
       3. Create portable backup
       4. Upload SQL database backup
       5. Generate SAS key
       6. Delete previous dry run organizations
       7. Rename imported organization
       8. Set up billing
