| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Basic Process | Need for the simplest model | Epic (in Portfolio backlog) 🠚 issue (in Product backlog) 🠚 task | ␀ |

| Scrum process | Need to align with Scrum | Same as agile but product backlog item instead of user story | impediment for issue & bug tracking |
| CMMI Process | Need to follow more formal project process | Same as agile but feature instead of user story | change request, issue, review, risk |
