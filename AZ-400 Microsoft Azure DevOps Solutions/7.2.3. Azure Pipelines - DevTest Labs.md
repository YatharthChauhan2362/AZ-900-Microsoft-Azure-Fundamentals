# Azure DevTest Labs

- VMs that can have lab policies:
  - to automatically shut down & start up VMs
  - to have caps e.g. max VMs per user or max costs
- To be used for e.g.:
  - Conduct compatibility and automated testing with reusable environment templates
  - Provide virtual machines for hackathons that automatically expire after the event.

## Use DevTest Labs in Azure Pipelines

- Two use-cases with Azure Pipelines:
  - Cheap way to create continuous test environments
    - E.g. for development and test environments
  - Create a [VM with golden image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lab-services/devtest-lab-integrate-ci-cd) to execute a specific task e.g. build Erlang/Hack.
- During the build/test phase
  - you can add ARM templates & supporting files to the build sources
  - so that during the release phase the exact configuration used to test with is deployed to production.
- You can use the Azure DevTest Labs Tasks extension with tasks such as:
  - Create Azure DevTest Labs Environment
    - ðŸ’¡ You can instead use an ARM template to deploy the environment instead of this task.
  - Deploy ARM template to existing Azure DevTest Labs Environment
    - You can provision both Azure PaaS resources & IaaS VMs
