# Release pipelines (legacy)

- GUI only
- It's legacy and will be replaced by multi-stage pipelines.
- A release pipeline consists of different stages per environment e.g. QA / Staging / Production
- You can:
  - Edit a particular release only (not entire pipeline)
  - Specify retention period for the releases
    - How many days + minimum number of releases
    - Global release retention policy
      - For on-premises Team Foundation Server
        - ❗ In Azure Pipelines, you can view but not change these settings for your project.
      - ***Maximum retention policy*** sets the upper limit for how long releases can be retained for all release pipelines
      - ***Default retention policy*** sets the default retention values for all the release pipelines
      - ***Destruction policy*** helps you keep the releases for a certain period of time after they are deleted
  - Minimum number of releases to retain for each pipeline

## Deployment pools & groups

- **Deployment pools** are [environment](./7.2.%20Azure%20Pipelines.md#environment)s in a release pipeline.
  - exists at the account level & contains agents (targets)
    - can be shared in different projects
    - **Permissions**
      - ***Reader***: can view
      - ***Creator***: can view & creator
      - ***User***: can view & use but cannot manage or create
      - ***Administrator***: Can administer roles, manage, view and use deployment groups
- **Deployment groups**
  - Layer over pools which makes these targets available to release definitions in a project
    - e.g. "Dev", "Test", "UAT", and "Production".
  - Project-scoped: Exists in a single project
  - Permissions:
    - ***Reader***: Can only view deployment pools.
    - ***Service account***: Can view agents, create sessions, and listen for jobs from the agent pool.
    - ***User***: Can view and use the deployment pool for creating deployment groups.
    - ***Administrator***: Can administer, manage, view and use deployment pools.
- You can [deploy gradually](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/apps/cd/howto-webdeploy-iis-deploygroups?view=azure-devops#perform-a-safe-rolling-deployment) to ensure application is available to the customers at all time:
  - Configure ***Maximum number of targets in parallel***

## Gates

- Not yet available for multi-stage pipelines, see [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/vsts-docs/issues/4497)
- Collect information from external services
  - then decide if a stage should run or not.
- Use-cases:
  - Incident and issues management, e.g. :
    - Ensure deployment occurs only if no priority zero bugs exist
    - Validate that there are no active incidents takes place after deployment
  - Seek approvals outside Azure Pipelines, e.g.:
    - Notify legal approval departments, auditors, or IT managers about a deployment by integrating with approval collaboration systems such as Microsoft Teams or Slack
  - Quality validation, e.g. :
    - Allow release only if code coverage >= 90
  - Security scan on artifacts, e.g.:
    - Anti-virus checking, code signing, and policy checking..
  - User experience relative to baseline, e.g.:
    - Ensure the user experience hasn't regressed from the baseline state
  - Change management, e.g.:
    - Wait for change management procedures in ServiceNow before deployment
  - Infrastructure health e.g.
    - Execute monitoring and validate the infrastructure against compliance rules after deployment
- Gate can be:
  - An Azure function that returns success or fail
  - Based on Azure Monitor alerts
  - Invoking an external REST APi to check success or fail
  - Query work items in Azure boards
    - ❗ Queries must be in "Shared Queries" folder.
  - Query compliance from within Azure Policies
- You can have multiple gateways between stages.
  - **Pre-deployment gates**: runs before the deployment stage
  - **Post-deployment gates**: runs after the deployment stage
- Can have delay before evaluation
  - E.g. wait for application reach a steady operational state before running penetration tests
- Can have evaluation options that applies to all gates:
  - timeout after which gates fail
  - time between re-evaluation of gates: sampling interval
  - minimum duration for steady results after a successful gates evaluation
