# Azure Migrate Service

- Free tool for primarily IaaS-based assessments.
- Good for lift-and-shift migrations.
- Supports VMware-virtualized Windows and Linux VMs.
- Non-intrusive discovery of on-premises VMs & workloads
- Examines & assets:
  - ***Azure readiness***
    - Suitability of on-premises machines
    - Asserts • ready for azure, • ready with conditions, • not ready for Azure, • Azure readiness unknown (when readiness cannot be identified due to data unavailability)
  - ***Sizing suggestions***
    - For VMs & disks based on history
    - Two settings:
      - As on-premises
      - Performance based
        - Based on utilization history
          - *Storage*: default is Premium disks
          - *Network*: performance required by network adapters
          - *Compute*: CPU & memory requirements
  - ***Cost estimation***
    - The estimated cost for running the machines & storages in Azure
  - ***High confidence migration***
    - Migration risks and recommended tools: recommends e.g. **Azure Site Recovery**
    - Visualize dependencies of on-premises machines through **dependency maps**
    - Create groups that you will asses and migrate together
- Assessment content
  - Target location, Storage type, Reserved Instances, Sizing criterion, Performance history, Comfort factor, VM series, Currency, Discount (%), VM uptime, Azure offer, Azure Hybrid Benefit
    - **Comfort factor**: Buffer that's applied on top of machine utilization data for VMs.
- ❗ Assesses only VMWare (>5.5) environments, for Hyper-V machines use *Azure Site Recovery Deployment Planner*.

## Flow

1. Create migration project
   - In Azure, create an Azure Migrate project.
2. Install **Collector**
   - You download .OVA & import in VMware vCenter as VM
   - Read-only VM to log
3. Configure **Collector**
   - You connect to console of VM or web to initiate the discovery
   - Copy & paste your project id and key from Azure.
   - It reads: config data, virtual processors, memory size, disk, network configuration, performance history (CPU utilization, memory, disk IOPS & throughput, network output to choose right size for VMs)
4. Select VMs or groups (can customize groups) & create assessment.
   - Customize machines in report to recalculate costs.
5. You can optionally install **Dependency Agent** to see dependency maps
