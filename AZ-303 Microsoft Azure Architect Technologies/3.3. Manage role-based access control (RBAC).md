# Manage role-based access control (RBAC)

## Create a custom role

- 📝 Steps (through either PowerShell or Azure CLI)
  1. Determine the permissions you need
     - Add in `Actions` and `NotActions` for data operations use `DataActions` and `NotDataActions`.
     - You can see all operations through `az provider operation list`.
  2. Create the custom role
     - `az role definition create`
     - You need to have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write` permissions on all `AssignableScopes` such as *Owner* or *User Access Administrator*
- ❗ Limitations
  - Azure supports up to 2000 role assignments per subscription.
  - When you transfer a subscription to a different tenant, all role assignments are permanently deleted. You must re-create your role assignments in the target tenant.
- 📝 Example:

  ```json
    {
      "Name": "Virtual Machine Operator",
      "Id": "88888888-8888-8888-8888-888888888888",
      "IsCustom": true,
      "Description": "Can monitor and restart virtual machines.",
      "Actions": [
        "Microsoft.Storage/*/read",
        "Microsoft.Network/*/read",
        "Microsoft.Compute/*/read",
        "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/start/action",
        "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/restart/action",
        "Microsoft.Authorization/*/read",
        "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
        "Microsoft.Insights/alertRules/*",
        "Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/*",
        "Microsoft.Support/*"
      ],
      "NotActions": [],
      "DataActions": [],
      "NotDataActions": [],
      "AssignableScopes": [
        "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId1}",
        "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId2}",
        "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId3}"
      ]
    }
  ```

## Configure access to Azure resources by assigning roles

- Through a resource
  - Modify in *Access control (IAM)* in any Azure object.
  - In *Check Access* tab you can check access level of individual user, group, service principal or managed identity.
  - Add a role assignment
    1. Access control (IAM)  -> Add role assignment
    2. Select **Role** e.g. *Virtual Machine Contributor*.
    3. In the Select list, select a user, group, service principal, or managed identity.
- For built-in global roles such as *Contributor*:
  - AD -> Users -> Select user -> Directory role -> +Add role
- Assign roles to licenses: Azure Active Directory > Licenses
- Assign roles to devices: Azure Active Directory -> Devices

## Conditional access policies

- **When this happens** -> **then do this**
- You also set Users the users performing an access attempt (**who**).
- Cloud apps: The targets of an access attempt (**what**).
- Controls (**when** this happens)
  - **Grant controls**
    - Support *AND* and *OR* operators.
    - **Compliant device**: Azure AD registered devices, Azure AD joined devices, Hybrid Azure AD joined devices
      - ***Hybrid Azure AD joined devices***: Windows desktops, laptops, and enterprise tablets that are joined to an on-premises Active Directory
    - **Approved client app** through Intune app protection policies
    - Enforce acceptance of **Terms of Use**
    - **Custom controls**: Validation through custom APIs.
  - **Session controls**
    - **Use app enforced restrictions**: The device information enables the cloud apps to know whether a connection is initiated from a compliant or domain-joined device.

## Azure AD Privileged Identity Management

- Provide **just-in-time** privileged access to Azure AD and Azure resources
- Assign **time-bound access** to resources using start and end dates
- Require **approval** to activate privileged roles
- Enforce **multi-factor authentication** to activate any role
- Use **justification** to understand why users activate
- Get **notifications** when privileged roles are activated
- Conduct **access reviews** to ensure users still need roles
- Download **audit history** for internal or external audit

## Azure AD Identity Protection

- **Detecting vulnerabilities and risky accounts**
  - Providing custom recommendations to improve overall security posture by highlighting vulnerabilities
  - Calculating sign-in risk levels
  - Calculating user risk levels
- **Investigating risk events**
  - Sending notifications for risk events
  - Investigating risk events using relevant and contextual information
  - Providing basic workflows to track investigations
  - Providing easy access to remediation actions such as password reset
- **Risk-based conditional access policies**
  - Policy to mitigate risky sign-ins by blocking sign-ins or requiring multi-factor authentication challenges
  - Policy to block or secure risky user accounts
  - Policy to require users to register for multi-factor authentication

## Configure management access to Azure

- Securing privileged access requires changes to
  - Processes, administrative practices, and knowledge management
  - Technical components such as host defenses, account protections, and identity management

### [Recommended roadmap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/security-planning)

#### Stage 1. Critical items (first 24-48 hours)

- Turn on [Azure AD Privileged Identity Management](#azure-ad-privileged-identity-management) that allows you to
- Identify and categorize accounts that are in highly privileged roles
  - E.g. Global administrator, Privileged role administrator, Exchange administrator,
 SharePoint administrator
  - Remove any accounts that are no longer needed in those roles.
- Define at least two emergency access accounts
  - E.g. if on-prem AD DS goes down.
  - Highly privileged and are not assigned to specific individuals.
- Turn on multi-factor authentication and register all other highly-privileged single-user non-federated admin accounts

#### Stage 2. Mitigate common attacks (between 2-4 weeks)

- Conduct an inventory of services, owners, and admins
  - Identify the users who have administrative roles and the services where they can manage.
  - Use Azure AD PIM to find out which users in your organization have admin access to Azure AD, including additional roles beyond those listed in Stage 1.
  - Ensure that your admin accounts have working email addresses attached to them and have registered for Azure MFA or use MFA on-premises.
- Identify Microsoft accounts in administrative roles that need to be switched to work or school accounts
- Ensure separate user accounts and mail forwarding for global administrator accounts
- Ensure the passwords of administrative accounts have recently changed
- Turn on password hash synchronization
- Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users in all privileged roles as well as exposed users
- Configure [Identity Protection](#azure-ad-identity-protection)) *(= ML to asses risks)*
- Monitor **Azure Activity Log**
- Establish incident/emergency response plan owners
- Secure on-premises privileged administrative accounts, if not already done
- Additional steps
  - Complete an inventory of subscriptions using Enterprise Portal
  - Remove Microsoft accounts from admin roles
  - Monitor Azure activity with Azure Activity Log and notifications
  - If you have built apps on Azure with on-prem access: Configure Conditional Access policies

#### Stage 3. Take control of admin activity (between 1-3 months)

- Complete an access review of users in administrator roles
- Continue rollout of stronger authentication for all users
  - E.g. enforce MFA and Windows Hello for high-level managers
- Use dedicated workstations for administration for Azure AD
  - **Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs)**
    - Provides a dedicated operating system for sensitive tasks that is protected from Internet attacks and threat vectors
- Establish integrated monitoring
  - The **Azure Security Center**
    - Provides integrated security monitoring and policy management
    - Across subscriptions
    - Helps detect threats that may otherwise go unnoticed
    - Integrates with a broad ecosystem of security solutions.
- Review [NIST standards](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf) and recommendations
- Inventory your privileged accounts within hosted Virtual Machines
  - Grant only the amount of access to users who need to perform specific jobs
- Integrate information protection
  - **Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS)** scans & classifies based on policies using **Azure Information Protection** classification labels.
    - E.g. confidentiality levels
- Implement PIM for Azure AD administrator roles
- Use Azure log integrations to send relevant Azure logs
  - To e.g. Azure Sentinel or other SIEM systems

## Stage 4: Continue building defenses (after 6 months)

- Review admin roles in Azure AD
- Review users who have administration of Azure AD joined devices
- Review members of built-in Microsoft 365 admin roles
- Validate incident response plan
- Additional steps for organizations managing access to Azure
