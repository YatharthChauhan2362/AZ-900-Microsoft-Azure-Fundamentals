# Serverless computing

- Abstraction of servers, infrastructure, and operating systems.
- Main flow: An event triggers code, code gets data, and gives output
- Activity based billing: Only pay when you use resources
  - Billing is based just on resources consumed or the actual time your code is running.
- Serverless applications in Azure:
  - **Compute**
    - [Azure Functions](#azure-functions)
  - **Storage**
    - [Azure Storage](./2.2.%20Azure%20Storage.md)
  - **Database**
    - Azure Cosmos DB
  - **Security and access control**
    - [Azure Active Directory](./3.1.1.%20Identities%20-%20Azure%20Active%20Directory.md)
  - **Cloud messaging**
    - [Event Grid](./5.1.1.%20Azure%20Queues%20(Storage%20Queues%20&%20Event%20Grid%20&%20Service%20Bus%20&%20Event%20Hubs%20&%20IoT%20Hub).md#event-grid)
    - [Service Bus](./5.1.1.%20Azure%20Queues%20(Storage%20Queues%20&%20Event%20Grid%20&%20Service%20Bus%20&%20Event%20Hubs%20&%20IoT%20Hub).md#service-bus)
  - **Workflow orchestration**
    - [Logic Apps](#logic-apps)
  - **API Management**
    - Azure API Management
    - Azure Function Proxies: single API surface that calls different functions
  - **Analytics**
    - Azure Stream Analytics
    - Event Hubs
  - **Intelligence**
    - Azure Bot Service
    - Cognitive Services

## Azure Functions

- FaaS: Functions as a Service
- Built on top of WebJobs SDK.
- No idle capacity charges.
- Execute event-driven code with any programming language.
- Can run locally or in the cloud
  - **Azure Functions Runtime** is free & [open-source](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host).
  - Local development requires bindings.
    - Bindings are a way to provide input and output to the function.
    - A function can have multiple input and output bindings.
    - They're defined in a Json file can have different parameters (queueName, tableName) etc. depending on bound target.
- Auto-scaling
  - Scale controller monitors the rate of events and uses heuristics to scales out/in.
  - ❗ A single function app will only scale to a maximum of 200 instances.
    - A single instance may process more than message/request at a time though.
- **Pricing**
  - **Consumption Plan**
    - Scale out automatically.
    - Billing is based on number of executions, execution time, and memory used.
  - **App Service Plan**
    - Linux only, you pay for the IaaS.
    - Provides cost predictability and warm start.
- By default, a function will timeout after 5 minutes, and a function can run for a maximum of 10 minutes.
- **Triggers**
  - Can be triggered by Event Hubs, storages, devices from IoT hub, custom sources etc.
  - Or with a scheduled by e.g. webhook, API, data processing.
    - Timer is scheduled with CRON expression
- Bring your own dependencies
  - Supports NuGet, NPM etc., allowing use of preferred libraries.
- Integrated security
  - HTTP-triggered functions can be protected with OAuth providers (AAD, google etc.)
- Code directly in portal or use deployments from GitHub, Visual Studio, etc.

### Best practices

- Avoid long running functions
- Use cross function communication
- Prefer stateless functions
- Defensive functions: An exception can happen whenever possible
- For scalability:
  - Share & manage connections
  - Don't mix test and production code in the same function app
  - Use async code but avoid blocking calls
  - Receive messages in batch whenever possible
  - Configure host behavior to better handle concurrency (max outstanding requests, max concurrent requests etc).

## Logic Apps

- Cloud & serverless only to orchestrate workflows.
  - Connects serverless functions and APIs.
- Can be integrated with on-prem connectors.
- Integrates data with apps.
- You can manage & manipulate data.
- Many built-in triggers
  - You can have polling triggers, push triggers or recurrence (time-based) triggers.
  - Other built-in triggers include: • HTTP • Request • Azure Functions • Batch • other Azure Logic apps
  - Can be extended.
  - Can be triggered time-based (recurrence scheduling)
- 200+ built-in connectors
  - Managed connectors: • Azure Service Bus • SQL Server • Microsoft Outlook • Azure Blob Storage • SFTP • SharePoint Online • Dynamics 365 CRM Online • FTP • Salesforce • Twitter • Azure Event Hubs • Azure Event Grid, ...
  - On-prem connectors: • BizTalk Server • File System • IBM DB2 • IBM Informix • MySQL • Oracle DB • PostgreSQL • SharePoint Server • SQL Server • Teradata
  - For additional cost: • Enterprise Connectors (SAP, IBM MQ..)• Integrations account connectors (B2B messages via special protocols, XML handling)
  - Each connector has specific actions
    - E.g. twitter has: • Post a tweet • Get followers • Get following
- Built logic with
  - Error handlers
  - Conditionals: `for each`, `condition (if)`, `scope`, `switch`, `terminate`, `until`.
  - Manage variables with expressions (such as `div`, `concat` etc)
    - Data operations: `compose`, `create html/csv`, `filter array`, `join`, `parse json`, `select`
    - Date Time: `add to time`, `convert time zone`, `current time`, `get future time`, `get past time`, `subtract from time`
    - Variables: `append to array`, `append to string`, `decrement`, `increment`, `initialize`, `set`
