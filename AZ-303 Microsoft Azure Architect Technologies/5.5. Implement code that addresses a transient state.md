# Implement code that addresses a transient state

## Durable functions

- An extension of Azure Functions that lets you write stateful functions
  - The extension manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you.
- Logic
  - You get starter object injected in JS & C# (`DurableOrchestrationClient`)

    ```pseudocode
    If starter => existing instance (instanceid) exists
      return HttpStatusCode.Conflict
    else
      starter => start new instance
      starter => create response from instanceid
      return response from starter
    ```
