# Backups

## Azure Backup

- Managed service for back-ups.
- Use for production workloads.
- Creates recovery points that are stored in geo-redundant recovery vaults.
  - Allows you to restore whole VM or specific files later on.

### Setting up

1. Create a recovery services vault
   - It stores your back-ups and recovery points.
   - Choose between geo-redundant (default) or locally redundant.
2. Define the backup in vault.
   - Snapshots (recovery points) are stored in the vault.
     - You can restore VM from any recovery point.
   - Create new back-up
     - Set backup goal with
       - Source: From where (Azure/on-premises/Azure Stack)
       - Object: What e.g. VM, SQL (depended on source)
       - üí° In Site recovery the action is called **protection goal**
     - Configure back-up policy:
       - Frequency (retention range): How often? Ex. once a day, weekly, yearly etc.
       - When exactly? (ex. 11:00 AM Sunday)
   - You can back-up directly with "Back-up Now"
3. Back-up virtual machine
   - Azure VM Agent must be installed on VM, they're already installed for VMs from gallery.
   - Backing up VMs is a within region.
     - ‚ùó You cannot back up VMs from one region to a Recovery Services vault in another region.
     - ‚ùó For every Azure region that has VMs to be backed up, at least one Recovery Services vault must exist in that region.
   - For on-premises, you need to install VM agent

### Restoring

1. You can choose to restore only files.
   - Restore types: <sup>[Three Ways to Restore Azure IaaS VMs](https://newsignature.com/articles/three-ways-restore-azure-iaas-vms/)</sup>:
     1. **Create a virtual machine**
        - Basic settings such as VNet,subnet and storage account.
        - ‚ùó Does not support advanced settings such as e.g. VMs under load balancer, multiple reserved IPs or multiple NICs.
     2. **Restore disks**
        - Copies VHDs into a storage account you specify.
        - You can then create a new VM using these disks or attach existing VM to the disk disk.
     3. **Direct File Recovery**
        - Select recovery point -> Download script to mount VM disks so you can browse them -> Once you restore files, unmount the drives.
2. Create a new VM
3. Create a new store disk (copies VHDs).
4. Replace existing VM
   - ‚ùó Only supported for unencrypted managed VMs from marketplace).

## Azure Site Recovery

- Protects from a major disaster scenario when a whole region experiences an outage.
  - E.g. due to major natural disaster or widespread service interruption.
- You can replicate to an Azure region of your choice.
- You can set up easily on Portal => VM => Disaster recovery with target region.
- Explained more [here](./2.6.2.%20Azure%20Site%20Recovery%20Service.md).

## Snapshots

- Read only-copies of managed disks.
- Provide a quick and simple option for backing up VMs.
- Snapshot for consistency requires you to stop VM, Azure backup handles it via en extension
- Can be used to rebuild VM / create new managed disks as they exist independently.
- Billed based on the used portion of the disk (not whole disk capacity).
