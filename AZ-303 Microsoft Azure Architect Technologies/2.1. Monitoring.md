# Monitoring

- Act of collecting & analyzing data to determine the performance, health, and availability of applications and their depended resources.
- 💡📝 Understanding the operation of applications and alerts helps fixing problems before they occur.

## Azure monitoring services

- **Application Monitoring**: • Application Insights
- **Deep Infrastructure Monitoring**: • Log Analytics • Management Solutions • Network Monitoring • Service Map
- **Core Monitoring**: • Azure Monitor • Advisor • Service Health • Activity Log

## Azure monitoring costs

- Use [Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) for a specific resource.
- Review estimated costs when creating a resource
- See spent costs through Subscription blade
  - You can task resources Cost analysis with e.g. *costCenter: marketing* to filter in cost analysis view.
    - 💡 Recommended to tag & export.
  - You can see your bill in "Invoices", opt-in for PDF invoices & download (more options available in *Azure Account Center*)
  - External services billed separately
- Get notifications through Azure Advisor or Azure Cost Management for anomalies and overspending risks.

## Azure Monitor

- PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Pipeline for metric log data coming from any Azure resource provider.
- Fastest telemetry pipeline: Faster than Log Analytics.
- Collected data is saved in Log Analytics to analyze, monitor, visualize metrics and query and analyze logs.
  - *Visualize*: • Dashboard • Views • Power BI • Workbooks
  - *Analyze*: • Metrics Explorer • Log Analytics
  - *Respond*: • Alerts • Autoscale
  - *Integrate*: • Event Hubs • Logic Apps • Ingest & Export APIs
- You can use alerts to proactively notify you based on rules with Azure Alerts.
- You can access through
  - Azure Insight & Analytics (OMS portal that's now legacy)
  - On Azure portal there's an existing resource called Azure Monitor.
  - Rest API, PowerShell & CLI

### Data types

- Two levels of logs: resource (*[metrics](#metrics)* and platform (*[activity log](#activity-log)*, *[resource log](#resource-log)*).
- All data types can be queried in Portal, PowerShell, Rest API or CLI.

#### Metrics

- On resource level
- All numerical values including
  - All Application Insights data / telemetry
  - System health from VMs (uses HyperV metrics without any configuration)
- Can be visualized & queried
- 30 days free to store & query
- E.g. requests and errors, average response time, infrastructure metrics

#### Activity Log

- On platform level.
- "Outside operations" that are subscription-level events.
- Previously known as "Audit Logs" or "Operational Logs".
- Determine "what, who and when" for any write operation taken on the resources.
- 90 days free to store, fore more send to Log Analytics (["connect" button in Activity Logs blade of Log Analytic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-activity)), archive to storage account ([click on Export to Event Hubs in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-archive-activity-log)) or  stream to other services ([click on Export to Event Hubs in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-stream-activity-logs-event-hubs)).
  - During export you create a Log Profile you control how/where/what is exported for how long.

##### Activity log categories

- **Administrative**
  - Every API call to Azure Resource Manager
  - E.g. create virtual machine or delete network security group
- **Service health**
  - Any service health incidents occurred in Azure
  - Come in 5 varieties: • Action Required • Assisted Recovery • Incident • Maintenance • Information • Security.
  - E.g. SQL Azure in East US is experiencing downtime.
- **Resource health**
  - Status of resources: • Available • Unavailable • Degraded • Unknown
  - E.g. Virtual Machine health status changed to unavailable
- **Alert**
  - All activations of Azure alerts.
  - E.g. CPU % on a VM has been over 80 for the past 5 minutes
- **Autoscale**
  - Events in autoscale engine defined by your settings.
  - E.g. Scale up action failed
- **Recommendation**
  - How to better utilize your resources.
- **Security**
  - Events by Azure Security Center
  - E.g. Suspicious double extension file executed.
- **Policy**
  - All effect action operations performed by Azure Policy.
  - Types include audit and deny
- 💡 Security monitoring should be set-up for Administrative, Security, Policy and ServiceHealth

#### Resource log

- On platform level.
- "Inside operations" within the resource.
- Resource-specific with common scheme where resources include their own properties.
- E.g. IIS logs, web server logging, failed request tracking.
- Can be streamed (to Power BI, Azure Functions etc.), added in blob storage, and sent directly to Log Analytics.
- 🤗 Formerly known as **diagnostic logs** [1]

[1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/terminology#october-2019---diagnostic-log-to-resource-log "Azure Monitor naming and terminology changes | Microsoft Docs"

### Diagnostic settings

- Diagnostic setting is resource deployed to send logs different destinations.
- Each Azure resource requires its own diagnostic setting
- A diagnostic setting consists of
  - Sources (depends on resource type)
  - [Destinations](#diagnostic-settings-destinations) (destinations to send)

#### Diagnostic settings destinations

- Logs can be sent to resources across subscriptions [4]
- Using Azure Lighthouse, it can be sent across tenants [4]
- Resources that can be sent include:
  - A storage account (`storageAccountId` [1])
    - Allows archival
    - Allows you to configure retention in days[5] (`retentionPolicy` [1])
    - 💡 Can enable immutable on blob storage to protect against tampering [2]
  - Log analytics workspace (`workspaceId`)
    - Metrics are converted to forms and sent to **Azure Monitor Logs**
    - Helps to query, visualize, set-up alerts and integrate with **Azure Sentinel**
  - Azure marketplace resource (`marketplacePartnerId`)
    - Also known as **partner integrations** [3]
    - E.g. Datadog, Elastic, Logz.io.
  - Event Hub (`eventHubName`)

## Azure Alerts

- All alert creation for metrics, logs and activity log across Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights
- Separation of operational and configuration views:
  - **Alert Rules**: Definition of the condition that triggers an alert
  - **Fired Alerts**: An instance of the alert rule firing
- Flow of alerts
  - Set-up alert rule
    - Target resource (e.g. storage account)
      - **Signal**:
        - Types are Metric, Activity log, Application Insights and Log
        - You can have multi-dimensional metrics & monitor multiple metrics with a single rule (currently up to two)
    - **Criteria**
      - Logic test: e.g. six-hour period when capacity is over 10 MB
  - Action group (= actions to do)
    - Grouping of different actions to take when the alert is triggered
    - Each action has name & action type e.g. email/sms/push/voice/webhook/automation runbook
      - ❗ Applied rate limiting:
        - SMS: No more than 1 SMS every 5 minutes.
        - Voice: No more than 1 Voice call every 5 minutes.
        - Email: No more than 100 emails in an hour.
        - Other actions are not rate limited.
  - Set alert rule name, description, severity (can be informational, warning, error, critical)
- Log alerts
  - Defined by Log Query (by Log Analytics), Time period, frequency, threshold.
  - *Number of results alert rules* always creates a single alert, while *Metric measurement alert rule* creates an alert for each object that exceeds the threshold

## Azure Advisor

- Uses telemetry & application configurations to give personalize recommendations and guidance for
  - high availability, security, performance, cost effectiveness *(monitors unused resources and spent)*.
- Common resource, free for all users
- You can download, filter, postpone, dismiss recommendations.
- You can customize by excluding subscription/resource groups, configuring utilization rules (e.g. you can as a subscription owner set CPU to lower threshold)

## Log Analytics

- PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- It's also referred as (newer names)
  - **Azure Monitor Logs**
    - Azure Monitor log data is stored in Log Analytics
    - The term is changed from "Log Analytics" to "Azure Monitor Logs" ([see](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/terminology#log-analytics))
  - **Log Search**
    - "Log Search" interface in Azure Monitor (Monitor -> Logs)
    - Or Log Analytics Workspace -> Logs
- Two main features
  - Log Analytics Workspace where Azure Monitor stores its data
  - Log search feature; collect, correlate, search, and act on data with any schema.
- Business value:
  - *Assessing updates*: From logs can guess average patching time
  - *Change tracking*: Abnormal behavior from a specific account by tracking changes throughout the environment
- Free to store logs for 90 days of charge
  - You can export to Excel, PowerBI, or use API to send data or get.

### Sending data to Log Analytics

- Log analytics uses push-model i.e. data is pushed to it.
- Data can be pushed from integrated sources including
  - Connected Azure sources e.g. IIS logs, custom text logs with custom fields, error level etc.
  - Office 365, Azure Automation, Back-ups
  - ❗️ You cannot change schema on ingestion time for integrated resources, only on query time.
- Data can also be pushed Linux & Windows systems with an agent
  - Agents include
    - Log analytics agent
    - Operations Manager
      - Allows using existing investments with SCOM (System Center Operations Manager)
      - SCOM agents communicate with SCOM Server over TLS 1.2 which forward events and performance data to Log Analytics.
  - You can install agents using a script via Azure Automation DSC (desired state configuration)
    - Agents are already installed in cloud Windows VMs
- You can also use Log Analytics REST APIs to send custom data with any schema you want

### Collect data across subscriptions

- Log analytics applies if in same subscription, or in same Azure Active Directory tenant.
- So single Log Analytics workspace can monitor across under same tenant.
- To collect data across subscriptions and tenants:
  - In customer subscription
    - Activity log (*export button*) => Event Hub
  - In Service provider subscription
    - Logic App (*When events are available in Event Hub -> Parse JSON (Body) -> Compose (Select Body in inputs) -> Send Data (Azure Log Analytics Data Collector)*)=> Log Analytics
- Azure Monitor Logs support query across multiple Log Analytics workspaces across subscriptions
  - E.g. `app("/subscriptions/b459b4f6-912x-46d5-9cb1-b43069212ab4/resourcegroups/Fabrikam/providers/microsoft.insights/components/fabrikamapp").requests | count`
  - Read more on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cross-workspace-query)

### Querying Log Analytics

- Each data source has documentation (description & name) of its properties.
- 📝 Main query tables: *Heartbeat, Perf, Usage, Event, Syslog, Alert*.
- You can connect to Activity Logs in Activity Logs section and query with `AzureActivity`

#### Kusto Query Language (KQL)

- A pipe-through language to query log analytics data
- E.g.: `Event | where (EventLevelName == "Error") | where (TimeGenerated > ago(1days)) | summarize ErrorCount = count() by Computer | top 10 by ErrorCount desc`
- Can generate charts `| render timechart` that can be pinned to dashboard.
