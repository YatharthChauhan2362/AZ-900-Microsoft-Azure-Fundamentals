# Virtual Networks

![Networking in Azure](img/networking.jpg)

- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- Virtual networks are software defined logical isolation that mimics the hardware.
- Virtual networks are defined with address space and at least 1 subnet.
  - üí° Use an address space that is not already in use either on-premises or in other VNets.
  - If it overlaps => you will have to reconfigure or recreate the VNet.
  - How many to choose? Be carefull!
    - üí° A best practice: "one octet further in"
    - E.g.: VNet (11.0.0.0/ **8** ) => Subnet (11.1.0.0.0/ **16** )
- ‚ùó Limitations:
  - By default, you can create up to 50 virtual networks per subscription per region, you can contact support to increase it to 500.
  - A virtual network and its resources are scoped to a single region and single subscription.
    - However, different VNETs from different regions can communicate through ***global peering***.
  - When you move VNet to another resource group, you must move all of its dependencies.
- Name resolution in a VNet:
  1. Azure-provided *(default)*
  2. Custom DNS server
     - E.g.: Deploy a DNS server and type its address.

## Filter network traffic

### Security groups

- Control inbound / outbound rules
- Network Security Groups
- Application security groups (on application level)

### Network virtual appliance (NVA)

- A network virtual appliance is a VM that performs a network function, such as a firewall, WAN optimization, or other network function.
- They're often used in DMZ (perimeter network)
  - **DMZ**: Security zone protects internal network from an untrusted network.

## Routing

### Route tables

- Associated to one or more subnets.
- Defines routes = where next hop will go
  - If matching route can't be found, the packet is dropped.

### System routes

- Azure manages following situations with **system routes**:
  - VM <=> VM in same subnet
  - VM <=> VM in different subnet in same VNet
  - Internet <=> VM
  - VNet-to-VNet VPN communication between VMs
  - Site-to-Site and ExpressRoute communication through the VPN gateway.

### Custom routes

#### User-defined routes (UDRs)

- To a virtual appliance (router, firewall, WAN optimization)
- Appliance between subnets tier (front-end back-end) or (subnet internet)
- üí° Deploy virtual appliance to different subnet. If it's in same subnet where it's routed it can result in routing loops where traffic never leaves the subnet.

#### Border gateway protocol (BGP)

- Standard protocol commonly used.
- Routes are automatically added to route table.
- Obligatory with Express Route, optional with VPN Gateway
- Support multiple tunnels.
- Provides transit routing between on-prem <=> Azure VNet via VPN gateway.
  - Transit route: A->B & B->C => A->C
- You can propagate your on-premises BGP routes to your virtual networks through Azure VPN Gateway or ExpressRoute connection.

### How Azure selects a route

- Routing algorithms:
  - If address matches multiple routes then Azure makes decision based on:
    1. ***Prefix match algorithm***: Less range is selected.
    2. ***Route priorities*** (if prefixes are the same)
       - User-defined route > BGP route > System route
- `0.0.0/0` address prefix => Routed to internet by default (can be overridden).

## Azure Gateways

- They're used to exit & come back in to private network.
- Requires gateway subnet to exist to the VNet
- ‚ùó Do not associate NSG on gateway subnet.

### Azure Application Gateway

- Layer 7 load balancers / reverse proxies
- ‚ùó Works with different availability zones but only across same region.
- Supports:
  - ***SSL termination***: Traffic flows unencrypted to the back-end servers.
  - ***Connection draining***: Remove back-ends using REST or they're removed automatically if their health status is not ok.
  - ***Custom error pages, Web application firewall, URL-based routing, multiple-site hosting, redirection, session affinity, websocket, rewrite HTTP headers***

### Azure Virtual Network Gateway

- It's assigned to a VNet in a gateway subnet.
  - A VNet can have 1 gateway subnet and only 1 gateway in it.
- Used for Azure <=> Azure or Azure <=> On-prem
- Traffic goes through public internet
  - Requires public IP.
- Two types: VPN, ExpressRoute
  - **Azure VPN Gateway**
    - Encrypts & routes the traffic via IPSec/IKE *(better than SSL)*
    - Between two or more virtual machines in **gateway subnets**.
- üìù Types:
  - **PolicyBased**
    - Also called **static routing**
    - IPSec policies decides where/whether to send.
  - **Route based**
    - Route table decides where/whether to send.
    - Also called **dynamic routing**
    - Required for **Multi-Site VPN**, **VNet to VNet**, and **Point-to-Site**.
- **SKU**
  - Limits the number of tunnels you can have and the aggregate throughput benchmark.
  - ‚ùó Basic has no public IP.
