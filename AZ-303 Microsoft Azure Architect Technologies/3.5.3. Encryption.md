# Encryption

- **Encryption**: Plaintext => Ciphertext, **Decryption**: Ciphertext => Plaintext
- Symmetric encryption
  - Uses symmetric key to encrypt & decrypt
    - The longer the key, the better it is
- Good encryption algorithm: been in use in several years + resisted all attacks.

## Encryption at rest

- Encoding (encryption) of data when it is persisted (stored)
- Azure uses symmetric encryption
  - For partitioned data, different keys may be used for each partition.
  - Data encryption keys are often encrypted with asymmetric encryption.
- Flow: *Resource providers <=> Data Encryption keys (DEKs) => Key encryption keys (KEKs) => Azure Key Vault (protected by Azure AD)*

### Azure Storage

- Enabled by default, cannot be disabled using **Storage Service Encryption (SSE)**
  - Does not affect the performance
  - You can use `Encryption Blade` to use custom key.
- Some services support customer managed keys & client-side encryption

### Azure SQL Database Encryption

- Uses **TDE (Transparent Data Encryption)** on server level as default.
- Encrypts data + log files.
  - Encryption happens in page level
    - Encrypted before writing to disk
    - Decrypted when read into memory
- Encrypts also SQL server + Azure Synapse Analytics (older name: Azure SQL Data Warehouse)
- Does not increase the size of the encrypted database.
- Uses **database encryption key (DEK)**
  - The key is stored in database boot record with a certificate for availability during recovery.
  - It can be symmetric key in master DB server, or asymmetric key protected by EKM (Extensible Key Management)

### Azure Cosmos DB encryption

- Database, media attachments, backups are encrypted by default.
  - Primary database is generally stored in SSDs
  - Media attachments & back-ups are stored in Blob storage (generally HDDs)

## Always Encrypted

- In Azure SQL Database and SQL server.
- Data is never plaintext inside database.
- Encrypted at rest, during movement between client <=> server, in another words when data is in use.
- Clients decrypts data with a key unknown to DB.
  - Separation between who own the data and who manage the data.
- Requires code changes, driver installed in server, change in connection string.

## Azure confidential computing

- Designed when data will never be in plaintext in cloud.
- Hardware vendors help it (e.g. Intel)
  - **Trusted Execution Environment**
    - No one can see the data.
    - If code is changed, operations are denied & environment is disabled.
    - No code changes required.
    - Exposing
      - **Hardware**: Intel CPU's with Intel SGX are available in VMs.
      - **Software**: SGX SDK + 3rd party can be used in VM & compute.
      - **Services**: Many Azure services including Azure SQL.
      - **Frameworks**: Ex: Confidential Consortium Blockchain Framework by Microsoft Research Team.

## SSL & TLS

- Security for communications over computer network.
- **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**
  - Used by many Azure services.
  - ‚ùó SSL (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) are vulnerable and prohibited by IETF.
- **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**
  - ‚ùó TLS 1.0 is insecure because of block chippers (CBC & RC2 CBC) and stream cipher (RC4).
  - üí° Recommended: Higher than TLS 1.0.
  - Supported by Azure Storage (default: TLS 1.2)

## Azure Key Vault

- Secrets store for e.g. password, DB credentials, API key, certificates.
  - Each secret gets URL, vault name must be unique.
- Backed by hardware security modules (HSMs)
- Control & logs access to anything stored in them.
- Can handle requesting & renewing TLS certificates
- Streamlines key management process
  - Dev, test keys and migration to production keys.
- Permissions to keys can be granted and revoked as needed.
- Usage
  - Accessible on Azure Portal
  - **In .NET**: You can use Azure SDK in C# with AzureServiceTokenProvider as authentication callback.
  - **In CLI**:
    - `az keyvault create`
    - `az secret set`
    - `az keyvault secret show`
  - **Rest API**:
    - Create key: `POST {vaultBaseUrl}/keys/{key-name}/create?api-version=7.0`
    - Delete certificate: `DELETE {vaultBaseUrl}/certificates/{certificate-name}?api-version=7.0`
    - Get secret: `GET {vaultBaseUrl}/secrets/{secret-name}/{secret-version}?api-version=7.0`
    - Update secret: `PATCH {vaultBaseUrl}/secrets/{secret-name}/{secret-version}?api-version=7.0`
