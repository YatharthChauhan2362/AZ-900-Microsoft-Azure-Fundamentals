# Networking

## OSI Layers

1. The physical layer
2. The data-link layer
3. The network layer
4. The transport layer ([Load Balancer](#azure-load-balancer))
5. The session layer
6. The presentation layer
7. 7 The application layer ([Application Gateway](#azure-application-gateway))

## Azure Traffic Manager

- Used for geo-routing.
- It provides DNS-based routing to redirect end user traffic to globally distributed end points.

## Azure Load Balancer

- OSI Layer 4 (TCP & UDP) load balancer that distributes inbound traffic to ***backend pools*** (resources) according to ***rules*** and ***health probes***.
  - For application-layer processing, see Application Gateway (e.g. SSL off-load)
  - For DNS load balancer (geo-based) see Traffic Manager
- In actual Azure infrastructure there's always a load balancer.
  - No instance is really created, capacity is always available.
- Front-end <=> Load balancer => *(through load balancing rules and health probs)* Back-end pools (includes VMs)
- Features
  - Instant scaling to applications
  - Reliability via health checks through health probes.
  - Secure: You can add NAT
    - Network Address Translation: remapping one IP to another in VM.
    - Lowers attack surface of the VMs that otherwise could be attacked directly.
  - Port forwarding => A frontend IP to a port of a back-end inside VNet.
  - Agnostic & transparent => Endpoint is only answered by VM (VM TCP handshakes)
- There are quick start ARM templates
  - E.g. 2 VMs internal load balancer.

### Load balancer types

#### Public load balancer

- Internet facing
  - Maps public IP+port of incoming traffic <=>  private IP+port.
- E.g. TCP port 80 <=> VMs in web tier subnet in a multi-tiered architecture.
- Can be placed in front of public load balancer to create multi-tier application.

#### Internal load balancer

- Routes traffic between VMs inside private VNETs or VNETs that use VPN access to Azure.
- Good for:
  - Handling communication within same VNet.
  - Hybrid scenarios: On-prem to VMs in same VNet
  - Multi-tiered applications
    - E.g.: an internal load balancer can receive DB requests that needs to be distributed to back-end SQL servers.
  - Critical (line-of-business) applications.
- Frontend IPs and VNets are never directly exposed to internet.
  - Accessed from within Azure or on-prem resources
- Can be used to create multi-tiered hybrid applications.

### Load balancer rules

- Determine how traffic is distributed to the backend.
- E.g. you can spread load of incoming web request traffic across multiple webservers.
- Settings: `Port`, `protocol`, `IP version`, `back-end port`, `backend pool`, `health probe`, `session persistence`, `floating IP (enable/disable)`
- **Back-end server pool**
  - IP addresses of back-end servers.
  - Back-ends span to two VNets, must be in same VNet.
- Front-end port is called **Listener** and can have SSL certificate.
- Frontend & backend pool are connected with **rules**.
  - Front-end is associated with the back-end VM through **rule definition**.
  - Rules reference to a health probe of target VM.
- You can set **Multiple Frontends**
  - Load balance on multiple ports, multiple IP addresses or both.
  1. **Default rule with no-back-end port reuse**
     - Each rule must have a flow with unique IP+port
     - Multiple rules can distribute flows to same DIP on different ports.
       - **DIP** = destination IP of VM
     - Example:

       | **Rule** | **Map frontend** | **To backend pool** |
       | --- | --- | --- |
       | 1 | 💚Frontend1:80 | 💚DIP1:80, 💚DIP2:80 |
       | 2 | 💜Frontend2:80 | 💜DIP1:81, 💜DIP2:81|

  2. ***Backend port reuse by using Floating IP**
     - If you want to reuse back-end port across multiple rules.
     - Good for: e.g. clustering for high availability, network virtual appliances, and exposing multiple TLS endpoints without re-encryption.
     - Example:

       | **Rule** | **Map frontend** | **To backend pool** |
       | --- | --- | --- |
       | 1 | 💚Frontend1:80 | 💚 DIP1:80, 💚DIP2:80 |
       | 2 | 💜Frontend2:80 | 💜 DIP1:80, 💜DIP2:80 |

     - **Floating IP** rule allows backend ports to be re-used.
       - It must be enabled.
       - It's a part of DSR (Direct Server Return)
         - Flow topology
           - Outbound part of a flow is always correctly rewritten to flow directly back to the origin.
           - At platform level LB operates this way.
         - IP address mapping scheme
           - By changing destination IP, you can enable port re-use on same VM.

#### NAT rules

- Must be explicitly attached to a VM (or network interface) to complete the path to the target
- Load balancing rule
  - VM is selected from the back-end address pool or VMs
- 📝 You would use NAT rule when you have 1 backend server or you know which backend server to get to and load balancing rule when you want to load balance to multiple backend servers.

### Session persistence

- 📝 Provides stickiness to same VM.
- 📝 A session is a 5-tuple hash of: Source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port *(public port)*, protocol *(optional)*.
- Settings
  - When adding a rule you can select only client IP or client IP + protocol.
  - Idle timeout: Default: 4 min, same server response via HTTP(S)/TCP sessions but no guarantee that connection is maintained.

### Health probe

- Allows resilience and scalability.
- The health probe dynamically adds or removes VMs from the load balancer rotation based on their response to health checks.
- Types:
  - **HTTP**: HTTP 200 => healthy (timeout : 31 seconds)
  - **TCP**: If connection is accepted / refused
  - **Guest probe**: Runs inside VM, not recommended
- Standard SKU sends health probe status as metrics through Azure Monitor.

### A high availability ports (HA ports)

- Is a variant of a load balancing rule for internal load balancers.
- Single rule to load-balance all TCP and UDP flows that arrive on all ports of an internal load balancer.
- Non floating: Cannot add more rules.
- Floating: can have same back-end instance or multiple back-ends.

### Pricing

- Not mutable, requires re-deploy.
- Basic SKU
  - Free
  - Subset of Standard
  - HA ports are not available
- Standard SKU
  - 💡 New applications should use Standard
  - More flexible & larger backend pools
  - Available only in Standard: Outbound rules (public IP, NAT, HTTPS), SLA
- When back-end pool probes down
  - Standard allows TCP connections to continue
  - Basic terminates all connections.

## Azure Application Gateway

- Application Delivery Controller (ADC) as a service
- Web traffic load balancer at "Layer 7 – Application"
  - As opposed to Load Balancer that operates at "Layer 4 – TCP and UDP"
- Application gateway can be configured as
  - Internet-facing gateway
  - Internal-only gateway
  - Combination of both
- You can configure more than one web site on same instance
  - ❗ Up to 20 web sites.
  - Each website is directed to its own backend pool of servers.
  - Implementation: 2 backend server pools, 2 listeners (type of multi-site), 2 routing rules.
- Other features
  - **Redirection**
    - One port to other port => enables HTTP => HTTPS and more (e.g. external site)
  - **Session affinity**
    - Keep a user session on the same server
  - **Other features**
    - WebSockets & HTTP/2 traffic, rewrite HTTP headers

### Azure Application Gateway components

- Frontend IP Configuration <=> Application Gateway (has WAF and is L7 LB) <=> Listener (through rules) => Backend Server Pool
- **Frontend IP configuration**
  - Traffic-facing port
- **Backend server pool**
  - The list of IP addresses of the backend servers.
  - The IP addresses listed should either belong to the virtual network subnet or should be a public IP/VIP.
  - Every pool has settings like port, protocol, and cookie-based affinity.
- **Listener**
  - Front-end configuration of the gateway.
  - has a front-end port, a protocol (HTTP or HTTPS), and the SSL certificate name (optional).
  - Can terminate SSL (SSL ofFloading), so that traffic flows unencrypted to the backend servers.
    - Unburdens from encryption & decryption overhead.
    - To implement this, upload certificate & set it on listener.
- **Rule**
  - Binds the listener and the backend server pool
  - Defines which backend server pool the traffic should be directed to when it hits a listener.
  - Health probes can be HTTP, HTTPS, default => default webpage, you can configure custom URL.
  - Path based rules allows routing based on paths
    - `/video/*` => video backend, `/picture/*` => picture backend
  - Rules are processed in the order they are listed
- **Web application firewall (WAF)**.
  - Centralizes security management of web applications = Simpler management.
  - Uses rules from OWASP Core Rule Set:
    - Protection against: SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), PHP Code Injection, Java Code Injection, Shellshock, Unix/Windows Shell Injection, Session Fixation, Scripting/Scanner/Bot Detection, Metadata/Error Leakages
  - You can deselect rules or disable the firewall.
