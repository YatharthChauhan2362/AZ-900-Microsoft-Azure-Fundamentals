# Design and Connectivity Patterns

## Partitioning workloads

- Modularize application to functional units.
- Each module
  - Handles portion of application's overall functionality
  - Represents set of related concerns.
- Why?
  - Easier to design both current & future iterations of your application.
  - Modules can also be tested & distributed and otherwise verified in isolation.

## Load balancing

- Application traffic or load is distributed among various endpoints by using algorithms.
- Allows
  - Multiple instances of the website can be created
  - They can behave in a predictable manner
  - Flexibility to grow or shrink the number of instances in application without changing the expected behavior
- Load balancing strategy considerations
  - Physical vs Virtual Load balancers
    - Use Virtual Load Balancers (hosted in VMs) if company requires a very specific configuration.
  - Load balancing algorithm
    - round robin => Selects next instance for each request based on a predetermined order that includes all of the instances.
    - random choice
  - Configurations
    - Affinity/stickiness: If subsequent requests from the same client machine should be routed to the same service instance.
    - Required when application has state.

## Transient fault handling

- Leads to more resilient applications.
- Implemented in .NET libraries (Entity Framework, Azure SDK etc)
- Transient errors=> occur due to temporary interruptions in the service or to excess latency.
- Many are self-healing and can be resolved with retry policy
- Retry policy
  - Retry when a temporary failure occurs.
  - A break in the circuit => abort retries if it's a serious issue.

## Queues

- Provides a degree of consistency regardless of the behavior of the modules.
- Direct method invocation
  - Connection is severed on transient errors
  - Use 3rd party queue to persist the requests beyond a temporary failure.
    - Allows you to audit failing requests independently.

## Retry pattern

- Cloud applications must be sensitive to transient faults.
  - E.g. loss of network connectivity, the temporary unavailability of a service, timeouts that arise when a service is busy.
- They're typically self-correcting, if the action that triggered a fault is repeated after a suitable delay, it's likely to be successful.
  - DB with too many concurrent requests can have throttling (fails until workload is eased). Fixes itself after some delay.
- Solution: Retry for temporarily fails.
  - Remote service => retry after short wait.
    - Fails again => Limit attempts to avoid brute forcing retry again until maximum tries are reached.
      - to spread requests from multiple instances of the application as evenly as possible.

## Competing consumers pattern

- Sudden large number of requests may cause unpredictable workload.
- Single consumer => risk of being flooded, or messaging system being overloaded.
- Solution: asynchronous messaging with variable quantities of message producers and consumers
  - Business logic in the application is not blocked while the requests are being processed.
  - Handle fluctuating workloads => system can run multiple instances of the consumer service.

## Cache-aside pattern

- Problem: Cached data consistency
  - A strategy is needed to ensure that the data is up-to-date & handle situations where the data in cache has become stale.
- Solution: read-through and write-through caching
  - Cache-aside => Effectively loads data into the cache on demand if it's not already available in the cache.
    - Not in cache? Fetch & add it to cache, modifications on cache=> write to data store.

## Sharding pattern

- Problem: hosting large volumes of data in a traditional singe-instance store
- Some limitations
  - Storage space: Upgrading disks is not easy.
  - Computing resources: It's not possible to always increase more
  - Network bandwidth: Network traffic might exceed
  - Geography: Reduce latency of data access for different across regions.
- Scaling up can postpone affects but only temporary solution
- Solution: partitioning data horizontally across many nodes
  - Divide data store into horizontal partitions, or shards.
  - Shard: Same schema but distinct subset of data.
  - Sharding can be in data access code, or storage system with transparent sharding
    - Abstracting physical location => High level of control over which shard contain which data.
      - Easier to migrate between shard without touching application logic.
      - Tradeoff => Additional data access overhead to determine the location of each data item as it's retrieved
  - For optimal performance & scalability
    - Split data in a way that's appropriate for the types of queries the application performs.
    - Sharding schema will exactly match requirements of every query.
    - E.g.:
      - In multi-tenant system => You lookup with tenant id + e.g. tenant's name, Tenant's name = sharding key
