# Authorization

- Act of verifying if someone has access to a certain operation/subsystem.
- What can you do?
- Authorization in past
  - Protocols like LDAP or tools like AD DS.
  - Application queried database whenever a user attempted to access an application.
- Today
  - Identity is managed by 3rd parties (Azure AD, Facebook, Google)
  - Information needs to be shared in a standardized way to applications.
- Simplest solution
  - Once users are logged in, ID provider is trusted by application and can share claims.

## Claims-based authorization

- To grant or deny access is based on arbitrary logic that uses data available in claims to make the decision
  - Claim
    - Name/value pair that represents what the subject is and not what the subject can do
    - E.g. `DateOfBirth = June 8, 1970`
- Implementation in .NET
  - Claim-based authorization checks are ***declarative***
    - Embedded in code against an action/controller, specifying claims required for current user, and optionally values of claims.
  - Claims requirements are defined in policies.
    - Define policies in `Startup.ConfigureServices`.
      - Require claim(s)

        ```C#
          services.AddAuthorization(options => options.AddPolicy("EmployeeOnly", policy => policy.RequireClaim("EmployeeNumber")));
        ```

      - Require claim values

        ```C#
          services.AddAuthorization(options => options.AddPolicy("Founders", policy => policy.RequireClaim("EmployeeNumber", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5")));
        ```

    - Apply policies on action/controller using `[Authorize(Policy = "EmployeeOnly")]`
      - 💡 Action overrides controller.

## Role-based access control (RBAC) authorization

- An identity can belong to one or more roles.
- Access is granted or denied based on roles.
- ❗ RBAC is built in ARM so classic deployment cannot use it
- 💡 Grant users/team least privileges to get their work done.

### Setting up RBAC in ASP .NET

- Authorize per role `[Authorize(Roles = "HRManager")]` or `[Authorize(Roles = "HRManager,Finance")]`
- 💡 Actions overrides controller declarations.
- For only authenticating, you can use `[Authorize]` and `[AllowAnonymous]`
- You can declare policies based on roles.
  - In `Startup.ConfigureServices`
    - Require single role: `options.AddPolicy("RequireAdministratorRole", policy => policy.RequireRole("Administrator"))`
    - Require multiple roles: `options.AddPolicy("ElevatedRights", policy =>policy.RequireRole("Administrator", "PowerUser", "BackupAdministrator"));`
- On actions and controllers you can then use `[Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdministratorRole")]`

### Role assignment

- Granting access by assigning a **Security Principal**, a **Role** at a **Scope**
- **Security principal**. User, group or service principal.
- **Role** : Built-in or custom role
  - Roles are specific to level,  app type (VM, storage)
- **Scope** : Subscription, resource group or  resource

### Azure built-in roles

- Azure has 70 built-in roles.
- Fundamental roles that apply all resource types:
  - **Owner**: Root, can delegate, can be scoped.
  - **Contributor**: Creates & manages but cannot delegate.
  - **Reader**: Read only access
  - **User access administrator**: Manages user access to Azure resources
