# Development for asynchronous processes

## Asynchronous Processing

- Multiple CPU cores enables multiple threads.
- In past, it was complex with locks, took years to master.
- Today, it's simplified with ex. TPL (Task Parallel Library).
- Task Parallel Library (TPL)
  - Extends System.Threading to simplify parallelism and concurrency.
  - Dynamical scaling of degree of concurrency for maximum efficiency.
  - Handles partitioning of work, scheduling threads in thread pool, cancellation, state management and more.
  - A task holds metadata about the delegate: whether delegate has started/completed executing and it's resulting value.
  - Use async-await to refactor TPL code.

## Serverless computing

- Useful for "gluing" together disparate systems (e.g. integration solutions)
- They can all define input, actions, conditions, and output.
- You can run each of them on a schedule or via a trigger.

### Azure Functions

- FaaS: Functions as a Service
- Support many languages such as C#, F#, Node.js, Java or PHP.
- Excellent for: data processing, integrating systems working with IoT, simple APIs/micro-services.
- Integrates with Azure and 3rd party services
  - Integrations can trigger your function or serve as input/output.
- You can edit & compile & test (with request manipulations) & save in Portal.
- One function app can have many functions.
- In .NET
  - Provided by Azure WebJobs SDK.
  - `json` specifies input/outputs.

    ```json
      {
        "disabled": false,
        "bindings":[ {
            "type": "queueTrigger",
            "direction": "in",
            "name": "message",
            "queueName": "announcementqueue",
            "connection":"StorageConnectionString"
          } ]
      }
    ```

  - Required fields: direction, name, type
  - C# script binds to "in" property as a method parameter:

    ```c#
      public static void Run(string message, System.TraceWriter log)
      {
        log.Info($"New message: {message}");
      }
    ```

### Logic Apps

- Build & schedule & automate processes as workflows.
- Scenarios: B2B, on-prem or cloud only or both, data/system integration, enterprise application integration (EAI).
- You can integrate with on-premises using an **On-premises Data Gateway**.
  1. Download and install gateway
  2. Create Azure resource for gateway (**on-premises data gateway**)
  3. Connect to on-premises data
     - Add a connector that supports on-premises connections, for example, SQL Server.
     - Select *Connect via on-premises data gateway.*
- Build visually in Logic Apps designer, available in Azure portal & Visual Studio. You can also use PowerShell & ARM templates for select tasks.
- Describe in a json template:

  ```json
  {
    "$schema":"https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2016-06-01/Microsoft.Logic.json",
    "contentVersion":"1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
      "uri": { "type": "string" }
    },
    "triggers": {
      "request": { "type": "request", "kind": "http" }
    },
    "actions": {
      "readData": {
        "type":"Http",
        "inputs": { "method":"GET"," uri":"@parameters('uri')" }
      }
    },
    "outputs": {}
  }
  ```

### Implement interfaces for storage or data access

- Blocking the calling thread during I/O
  - Thread enters a wait state which other operations can't use it.
  - Anti-pattern as it reduces performance & bad for vertical scalability.
- Asynchronous code
  - Do not wait for I/O, transition long-running work other CPU cores.
  - Allows servers to handle more requests & UIs to be more responsive.
- Use asynchronous interfaces for all data tier code, pair those with interfaces with asynchronous versions.
  - E.g. if you have Entity Framework in controller, you'll need to rewrite code if you use another mapper or database in future => Use interfaces with async implementation.
