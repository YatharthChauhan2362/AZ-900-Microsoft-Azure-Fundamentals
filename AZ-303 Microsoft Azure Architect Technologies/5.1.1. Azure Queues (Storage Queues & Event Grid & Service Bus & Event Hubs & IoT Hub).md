# Azure Queues

- Queues using pull model: • [Storage queues](#storage-queues) • [Service bus](#service-bus) • [Event Hubs](#event-hubs) • [Azure IoT Hub](#azure-iot-hub)
- Queues using push model: • [Event grid](#event-grid)
- 💡 Queues using pull model can be integrated with [Event grid](#event-grid) to push the events.

## Storage Queues

### Implement Azure storage

#### Send message

  ```c#
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));
    CloudQueueClient queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();
    CloudQueue queue = queueClient.GetQueueReference("myqueue");
    queue.CreateIfNotExists();
    CloudQueueMessage message = new CloudQueueMessage("Hello, World");
    queue.AddMessage(message);
  ```

#### Receive message

- Peek: `CloudQueueMessage peekedMessage = queue.PeekMessage();`
- Read & dequeue
  - Get message (message becomes invisible for 30 seconds):  `CloudQueueMessage retrievedMessage = queue.GetMessage();`
  - Delete message to dequeue: `retrievedMessage.DeleteMessage(retrievedMessage);`

## Service Bus

- PaaS for web applications.
- Managed messaging infrastructure across private & public cloud.
- Uses pull model, can be integrated with [Event Grid](#event-grid) to have push model
- Extends [Storage queues](#storage-queues) with middlewares, publish/subscribe messaging, load balancing, FIFO.
- Can be used to connect on-prem with cloud or cloud to cloud.

### Service Bus Concepts

- Communication mechanisms
  - **Queues** (simple queues)
    - Each queue acts as broker (intermediary) that stores messages until sent.
    - One directional broker: Message is sent to single recipients.
  - **Topics** (publish-and-subscribe)
    - One-directional broker: single topic can have multiple subscriptions.
    - Can use filters
  - **Relays** (connects with direct communication)
    - Bidirectional communications
    - No storage or broker: just passes messages to the destination.
- **Namespaces**
  - Application scoped container for all messaging components.
  - Can have multiple queues & topics.
  - Can have different communication mechanisms
- **Messages**
  - Decouples applications.
  - Enables 1:n relationships with topics & subscriptions
  - Message sessions enables message ordering or deferral.
  - Decouples applications: improves scalability and reliability.
- **Queues**
  - Offers FIFO with ordering + timestamps or more competing consumers.
  - Messages are delivered in pull mode, held in redundant storage.

### Implement Azure Service Bus

- Using C#
  - Send batch to queue

    ```c#
      QueueClient queueClient = new QueueClient(ServiceBusConnectionString, QueueName);
      string messageBody = $"First Message";
      Message message = new Message(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(messageBody));
      await queueClient.SendAsync(message);
      var messages = new List<Message>();
      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      {
        var message = new Message(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes($"Message {i:00}")};
        messages.Add(message);
      }
      await queueClient.SendBatchAsync(messages);
    ```

  - Handle a message
    - In client SDK, you have handler callback you call either `CompleteAsync` or `AbandonAsync` (you receive the message again)
- Create namespaces where pub/subs will meet
  - Provides a service + security boundary.
  - Can be integrated with **Azure Relay**
    - Integrates on-premises communication easily.
    - Less intrusive than VPN.
    - Traditional one-way, request/response, and peer-to-peer communication
    - Event distribution at internet-scope to enable publish/subscribe scenarios
    - Bi-directional and unbuffered socket communication across network boundaries.
  - The name provides a unique identifier for the object. For example, `sbces12345.servicebus.windows.net`
- Create a queue
  - You can select: • Message time to live • Lock duration • Duplicate detection (duplicates won't be accepted) • Dead lettering (hold messages can't be delivered in another queue) • Sessions (guarantees FIFO) • Partitioning.
- 📝 Receiving an event
  - `ReceivesAndDelete`
    - Simplest, ok if system can tolerate if a message is missing if it  can't be handled
  - `PeekLock`
    - `CompleteAsync` => Message is handled & deleted
    - `AbandonAsync` => Re-queued

### Publish/Subscribe

- **Temporal decoupling**
  - Producers (senders) and consumers (receivers) do not have to be sending and receiving messages at the same time, because messages are stored durably in the queue.
- **Load leveling**
  - Producers consumers send & receive messages at different rates.
  - You don't have to pay for a system that is underutilized part of the time.
- **Loose coupling**
  - Resilience because messages are durable until they reach the worker.
- **Load balancing**
  - Bring on more workers as the queue increases.
- **Topics and subscriptions**
  - One to many (receivers)
  - Messages can be filtered in topics
- Other features
  - Auto-forwarding
  - Batching
  - Scheduled delivery (delayed processing)
  - Nessage deferral

### Azure Service Bus Pricing

- **Premium**
  - Fixed size
  - Predictable performance
  - Up-down scaling
  - Messages up to 1 MB
- **Standard**
  - Elastic
  - Auto-scaling
  - Message size up to 256 KB

### Service Bus Monitoring

- Metrics
  - **Request metrics** counts the number of requests.
  - **Message metrics** counts the messages (active, incoming, outgoing etc)
  - **Connection metrics** active/opened/closed messages
  - **Resource usage metrics** in Premium: CPU/memory size usage per namespace.
- Diagnostics Logs
  - E.g. • `ActivityId` • `EventName` • `resourceId` • `SubscriptionId` • `EventTimeString` • `EventProperties` • `Status` • `Caller` • `category` (= `operationalLogs`)

### Service Buses vs Storage Queues

- Service buses are built on top of storage queues and are more advanced:
  - Clients can use AMQP (ISO standard for queueing)
  - FIFO is guaranteed with sessions.
  - And other features such as batch send, automatic dead lettering, message auto-forwarding, message groups, duplicate detection, sessions, transactions, duplicate detection, durable publish/subscribe.
- In storage queues is REST only, FIFO is not guaranteed, lease/lock is on message level (while it's on queue level in service buses).

## Event Grid

- iPaaS: Integration Platform as a Service
- Fully managed, http-based event routing service for events.
- It connects and integrates all Azure services.
  - You can create events in Events blade of resources (e.g. blob storage)
- Eliminate polling because it's expensive.
  - Long polling: Server waits until the data is available instead of empty directly.
    - it is very expensive in terms of CPU, memory and bandwidth
- Concepts
  - Event Publishers (sources) => *(through topics)* Event Grid => *(through subscriptions)*  Event Handlers
  - **Topic**: Endpoint where the source sends events.
  - **Event Subscription**: what you're interested in receiving
    - Can be filtered
    - Can have expiration date.
- Batching is supported (array of events) and recommended.
- Use case example:
  - Ops automation: New VM created or SQL DB spun up => check whether configurations are compliant, tag, file work items etc.
- You can use custom events
  - Get easy to use UI
  - Native integrated event handlers
  - Uniform consumption of events
- Uses pub/sub model.
  - Can send events to multiple recipients
- Pricing:
  - Pay by number of operations
  - `Published events + delivery attempts - monthly free grant (100k) = total operations x $0.60`

## Event Hubs

- Big data streaming platform and event ingestion service.
  - **Event ingestion**
    - "Front door" for an event pipeline
    - Sits between publishers and consumers.
- Seamless integration with data + analytics services inside/outside Azure.
- Key components
  - **Event Producers**
    - Can publish using HTTPS, AMQP 1.0 or Apache Kafka.
  - **Partitions**
    - Views of consumers (state + position + offsets)
  - **Throughput units**
    - Prepurchased units to control capacity of EventHubs
  - **Event receivers**
    - Connect via AMQP 1.0.
- Can be integrated **Azure Stream Analytics**
  - Azure Stream Analytics: PaaS for parallel Complex Event Processing (CEP) pipelines for BI.

## Azure IoT Hub

- Central message hub for bidirectional communication between IoT application and the devices it manages.
- Use cases include device to cloud telemetry, file upload from devices, request-reply.
- You can run Azure services (Azure Functions, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Machine Learning, ..), or your own code on-prem on devices with remote cloud monitoring & management
- **EventHubs vs Azure IoT Hub**
  - Azure IoT Hub leverages Event Hubs for its telemetry flow path
  - Both support the ingestion of data with low latency and high reliability
