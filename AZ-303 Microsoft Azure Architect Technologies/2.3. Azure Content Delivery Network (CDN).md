# Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)

- Increases speed and availability
- Caches content to the user by using servers that are closest to the users.
- Can compress (can be enabled in Azure portal).
  - Also modify the MIME types list to tune which content formats to compress.

## Flow

1. User sends request to an *Edge Server*
2. DNS routes the request to the best performing Point-of-Presence (POP) location (probably geographically closer)
3. If edge does not have the content, it sends request to origin.
   - Origin can add HTTP headers describing the file's Time-to-Live (TTL).

## CDN Profiles

- You can choose between Microsoft, Akamai or Verizon as implementation.
- Four choices for **Origin type**: Storage, Cloud Service, Web App, and Custom origin.
- Supports compression, query string, and geo filtering.
- Endpoint isn't immediately available for use.
  - Microsoft standard = 10 min, Akamai = 1 min, Verizon = 90 min
- Rules
  - You can set global caching rules
    - e.g. TTL Cache Expiration Duration
  - Or custom caching rules
    - If a pattern match in path & file extensions you can override global caching rules.

### Optimization options

- Vendor specific settings
- ***General web delivery***: Web content, website, applications, small images
- ***General media streaming***: Live & video (so  you don't need to change between live and VOD).
- ***Video on demand media streaming***: Only for video streaming.
- ***Large file download***: Large file download: > 10 MB.
- Uses chunking
  - To disallow failing of whole request.
  - Uses pre-fetch: starts fetching next chunk if the download is on the chunk before.
