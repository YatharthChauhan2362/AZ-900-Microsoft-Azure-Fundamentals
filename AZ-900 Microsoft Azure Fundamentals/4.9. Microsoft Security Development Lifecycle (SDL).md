# Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)

- Set of guidance, best practices, tools, and processes
  - used internally at Microsoft to build more secure products and services.
- Introduces security and privacy considerations throughout all phases of the development process.
- Helps developers
  - build highly secure software
  - address security compliance requirements
  - reduce development costs.

## Provide training

- Security is everyone's job
  - E.g. developers, service engineers, and program and project managers.
- Everyone must understand
  - security basics
  - how to build security into software & services
  - attacker's perspective, their goals, and the art of the possible

## Define security requirements

- Security requirements must be updated continuously in order to address changes in required functionality and changes to the threat landscape.
- Optimal time to define the security requirements is during the initial design and planning stages.
  - Early planning allows development teams to integrate security in ways that minimize disruption.
- Factors that influence security requirements include, but are not limited to:
  - Legal and industry requirements
  - Internal standards and coding practices
  - Review of previous incidents
  - Known threats
- Track requirements through e.g.
  - work-tracking system
  - telemetry from the engineering pipeline.

## Define metrics and compliance reporting

- Essential to define the minimum acceptable levels of security quality
  - and to hold engineering teams accountable to meeting that criteria.
- Good to define as early as possible to apply standards throughout the entire project.
- E.g. all known vulnerabilities discovered with a "critical" or "important" severity rating must be fixed with a specified time frame.
- Track & report security work
  - Allows to have key performance indicators (KPIs)
  - Ensures security tasks are completed
  - Bug/work tracking mechanism should allow for security defects and security work items
    - to be clearly labeled as security
    - marked with their appropriate security severity

## Perform threat modeling

- USE in environments where there is a meaningful security risk.
- Allows development teams to consider, document, and discuss the security implications of designs.
- Applying a structured approach to threat scenarios helps a team.
  1. Effectively and less expensively identify security vulnerabilities
  2. Determine risks from those threats
  3. make security feature selections and establish appropriate mitigations.
- You can apply threat modeling at the component, application, or system level.

## Establish design requirements

- Assurance activities that help engineers implement more secure features, e.g. well engineered for security.
- Methods e.g. cryptography, authentication, and logging.
- Complicated design & security features are likely to result in vulnerabilities.
- Crucial to apply consistently and with a understanding of the protection they provide.

## Define and use cryptography standards

- [Encrypt in transit](./4.5.%20Encryption%20(Azure%20Key%20Vault,%20Certificates).md#encryption-in-transit) to protect data from being alteration & unintended disclosure when moving.
- Making an incorrect choice when using any aspect of cryptography can be catastrophic.
  - Best to develop clear encryption standards with specifics on every element of the encryption implementation.
- Only use industry-vetted encryption libraries: Encryption should be left to experts.

## Manage security risks from using third-party components

- Understand the impact of security vulnerability in third-party components to rest of the system.
- Plan to respond when new vulnerabilities are discovered & consider additional validation

  - [Managing Security Risks Inherent in the Use of Open-Source Software](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/opensource/)

## Use approved tools

- Define and publish a list of approved tools and their associated security checks.
  - e.g. compiler/linker options and warnings.
- Strive to
  - use the latest version of approved tools (such as compiler versions)
  - utilize new security analysis functionality and protections.

## Perform Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST)

- Analyzing source code prior to compilation
  - provides a highly scalable method of security code review
  - helps ensure that secure coding policies are being followed
- Typically integrated into the commit pipeline to identify vulnerabilities each time the software is built or packaged.
- Some offerings replace flawed (e.g. unsafe/banned) functions while developer is coding.

## Perform Dynamic Analysis Security Testing

- Performs run-time verification when all components are integrated and running.
- Achieved using a tool
  - e.g. a suite of pre-built attacks
  - e.g. to specifically monitor application behavior for memory corruption, user privilege issues, and other critical security problems.
- Some tools can be more readily integrated into the CI/CD pipeline
  - e.g. such as web app scanning tools
- Other such as fuzzing requires a different approach.

  - [Automated Penetration Testing with White-Box Fuzzing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc162782.aspx)

## Perform penetration testing

- Security analysis of a software system by simulating the actions of a hacker.
- Uncovers potential vulnerabilities resulting from e.g.
  - coding errors, system configuration faults, or other operational deployment weaknesses.
- Finds the broadest variety of vulnerabilities
- Often performed in conjunction with automated and manual code reviews.

## Establish a standard incident response process

- Crucial for addressing new threats that can emerge over time
- The plan should be created in coordination with your organization's dedicated Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT).
- Your incident response plan should:
  - Include who to contact if a security emergency occurs
  - Establish the protocol for security servicing (including plans for code inherited from other groups within the organization and for third-party code)
  - Be tested before it is needed
