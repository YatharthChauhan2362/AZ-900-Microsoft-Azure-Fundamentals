# Shared Responsibility Model

- Cloud security is a shared responsibility of both cloud providers and customers.
- Azure has many security certifications from outside auditors.
- **Physical security**
  - Handled by Microsoft
  - Walls, cameras, gates, security personnel
  - Strict procedures for employees
- **Digital security**
  - Handled by customer + Microsoft
  - Azure has tools to mitigate security threats, consumer is responsible to use the tools.
  - E.g. role-based access control, multi factor authentication, encryption, monitoring tools such as login failures, suspicious locations, DDoS protection, real-time telemetry & firewalls.
- ❗ You **always** retain responsibility for: Data, Endpoints, Accounts, Access management (identities)

## Cloud computing levels
