# Compute

- Primarily for  performing calculations, executing logic and running applications
- On-demand & computing service for running cloud-based applications
- Provides computing resources like multi-core processors and supercomputers via virtual machines and containers.
- Provides serverless computing to run apps without requiring infrastructure setup or configuration.
- Pay only for the resources you use and only for as long as you're using them.
- Four common techniques for performing compute in Azure:
  - [Virtual machines](./3.1.1.%20Virtual%20Machines.md) <sup>IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service</sup>
  - [Containers](./3.1.2.%20Containers.md)
  - [Azure App Service](./3.1.3.%20App%20Service.md)
  - [Serverless computing](./3.1.4.%20Serverless%20Computing.md)

## Choosing a computing strategy

- "All or nothing" is not needed when choosing a cloud computing strategy.
- Each provides benefits as well as tradeoffs against other options.
- E.g. serverless computing removes the need for you to manage infrastructure
  - Serverless computing expects work to be completed quickly; usually within seconds or less.
  - You might run your core application on a virtual machine or container but offload some of the data processing onto a serverless app.
