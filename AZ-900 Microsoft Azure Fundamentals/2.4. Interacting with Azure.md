# Interacting with Azure

- **[Azure portal](#azure-portal)** for interacting with Azure via a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- **[Azure PowerShell](#azure-powershell)**,  **[Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)](#azure-cli)** and **[Azure SDKs](#azure-sdks)** for command line and automation-based interactions with Azure
- **[Azure Cloud Shell](#azure-cloud-shell)** for a web-based command-line interface
- **[Azure mobile app](#azure-mobile-app)** for monitoring and managing your resources from your mobile device

## Azure portal

### Dashboards

- High-level details about your Azure environment.

  - At the top you to create, upload, reset, download (JSON), edit, clone, switch, delete and share a dashboard.
  - In **Tile Gallery** you have different tiles such as Clock, ARM data, Audit Logs, Service Health, AD Connect.
    - Some tiles have editable settings, e.g. for clock you can set the time zone.
  - üí° You can take elements on child panes and put them on your dashboard. Hover the item in `...` menu select "Pin to Dashboard"
- Multiple dashboards are supported, and you can switch between them as needed.
  - E.g. DB admin would have a dashboard that contains views of the SQL database service
  - E.g. Azure Active Directory administrator would have views of the users and groups within Azure AD

- You can use [role-based access control (RBAC)](./4.4.%20Identity%20and%20Access%20(Azure%20AD).md#role-based-access-control) to control who can access that dashboard.
- Azure stores dashboards within resource groups as JSON files
  - so you can customize them [programmatically](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards-create-programmatically)
  - üí° The easiest starting point is to download the dashboard JSON as previously described and edit that file.

- The default dashboard is named Dashboard.
