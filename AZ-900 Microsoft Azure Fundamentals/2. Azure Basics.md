# Azure Basics

- Azure is Microsoft's private & public cloud computing platform
- Provides developers & IT admins tools to provide, build, manage, and deploy applications.
  - on a massive global network
  - freedom to choose tools and frameworks
- More than 90% of Fortune 500 companies run on the Microsoft Cloud [[source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure/1-introduction)]

## Azure services

- More than 100 services..
- **Compute services** such as VMs and containers that can run your applications
- **Database services** that provide both relational and NoSQL choices
- **Identity services** that help you authenticate and protect your users
- **Networking services** that connect your datacenter to the cloud, provide high availability or host your DNS domain
- **Storage solutions** that can accommodate massive amounts of both structured and unstructured data
- **AI and machine-learning** services can analyze data, text, images, comprehend speech, and make predictions using data

## How Azure works

- It uses virtualization
  - Uses an abstraction layer called **hypervisor**.
    - Separates tight coupling between hardware (CPU, RAM, GPU..) and its operating system
    - Emulates a real computer in a **virtual machine**
      - Can run multiple virtual machines in same time
      - Optimizes capacity of abstracted hardware
      - Can run any OS such as Windows, Linux & macOS
- Azure repeats virtualization in massive scale
  - Each data center has many racks filled with servers
  - Each server includes a hypervisor to run multiple virtual machines.
  - A network switch provides connectivity to all those servers
  - One server in each rack runs a special software called **fabric controller**
    - Each fabric controller is connected to another software called as **orchestrator**
      - Orchastrator manages everything in Azure, including responding user requests
        - Users requests using **Azure API**
          - Azure API can be reached in many ways including Azure Portal
        - Orchestrator packages everything it's needed and sends to package & request to fabric controller.
