# Account, Subscription, Support and Billing

- Requires: Phone number, credit card identity verification, Microsoft/GitHub account.

## Subscription

- Used to create and use Azure services
- Created for you when you sign up
- üìù Logical container used to provision resources in Azure such as virtual machines, databases and more.
- üìù When you create an Azure resource like a VM, you identify the subscription it belongs to
  - As you use the VM, the usage of the VM is aggregated and billed monthly.
- üìù Each subscription is a separate entity that can't be merged.

### Multiple Azure Subscriptions

- You can create new subscriptions to separate e.g.
  - **Environments**
    - E.g. for testing, security, or to isolate data for compliance reasons.
    - üí°Useful because resource access control occurs at the subscription level.
  - **Organizational structures**
    - E.g. limit a team to lower-cost resources & allow IT department a full range
    - üí°Allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision within each subscription
  - **Billing**
    - Costs are first aggregated at the subscription level
      - Manage and track costs based on your needs
    - E.g. for production, development, testing
- Or due to **subscription limits**:
  - Subscriptions are bound to some hard limitations
    - E.g. the maximum number of Express Route circuits per subscription is 10

## Billing

- You'll receive a monthly invoice with payment instructions provided
  - You also can get set up for multiple invoices.
- Customize billing
  - Allows you to e.g. have single invoice for organization but organize charges by department, team, or project.
  - Billing structure:
    - ![Azure billing structure](./img/billing-structure.png)
    - Each **billing account** has billing profile
      - Each **billing profile** has different invoice sections
        - Each **invoice section** can be coupled to different subscriptions.
          - Each invoice section is a line item on the invoice that shows the charges incurred that month
