- You can use Security Center during the [detect](#detect), [assess](#assess), and [diagnose](#diagnose) stages.

##### Detect

- Review the first indication of an event investigation.
- E.g. you can use the Security Center dashboard to review the initial verification that a high-priority security alert was raised.

##### Assess

- Perform the initial assessment to obtain more information about the suspicious activity.
- E.g. obtain more information about the security alert.

##### Diagnose

- Conduct a technical investigation and identify containment, mitigation, and workaround strategies.
- E.g., follow the remediation steps described by Security Center in that particular security alert.

### Recommendations to enhance security

#### Security policy

- Set of controls that are recommended for resources within that specified subscription or resource group
- You can reduce the chances of a significant security event by configuring a security policy

#### Recommendations

- Based on security policies for potential vulnerabilities.
- Guide you through the process of configuring the needed security controls.
- E.g. if you have workloads that do not require the Azure SQL Database Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) policy, turn off the policy at the subscription level and enable it only in the resources groups where SQL TDE is required.
