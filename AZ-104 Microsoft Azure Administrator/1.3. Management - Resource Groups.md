# Resource groups

- Logical grouping of resources that shares the same lifecycles.
  - Resource group holds different unique resources.
  - Resource groups can contain resources that reside in different regions.
    - Location of resource group is just the meta data for the resource group.

## Tags

- Categorization / organization of resource groups for e.g. billing, management
- E.g. `Dept: IT`
- üí° Tags are not inherited
- ‚ùó Max 15 tag name/value pairs.

## Locks

- For accidental deletion or accidental changes to resources within a resource group.
- Consists of two locks:
  - `CanNotDelete`
    - Authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource.
  - `ReadOnly`
    - Authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource.
    - Same as giving everyone a ***Reader*** role.
- Locks are inherited from resources within the resource group.

## IAM

- Access control, RBAC
- Roles are inherited
- ***Role assignment***: Role definition role (role, e.g. Reader) + Person/Scope/Service Principal + Scope

## Policies

- Azure entity that controls behaviors within a resource group
  - Allow you to keep compliant with corparate standards and SLAs.
  - Set in a ***scope*** with a ***name*** and ***definition***.
    - Scope: E.g. resource group, subscription.
    - Definition: E.g. *"Allow resource types"*
      - Name, description, Policy (e.g. `azurepolicy.rules.json`), Parameters (e.g. `azurepolicy.parameters.json`)

## Events

- Create event subscriptions triggered by the resources group in Event Grid.

## Automation Script

- Can be added to library to be redeployed later on.
  - ‚ùó All resources cannot be redeployed
  - üí° Must change the name to avoid duplicates.
- ARM templates for resource groups can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates).
