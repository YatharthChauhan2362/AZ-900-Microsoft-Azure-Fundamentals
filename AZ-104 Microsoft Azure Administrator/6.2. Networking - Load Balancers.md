# Load Balancer Options

- All load balancers are software appliances (software defined networking: SDN)
- ðŸ’¡ Only Standard (not Basic) SKU allows availability zones in Load balancer

## Public Load Balancer

- OSI Layer 4 TCP and UDP
- Internet-facing, has public IP address
- Offers two distribution modes
- ***Set-up public load balancer***
  1. Settings -> Back-end-pools-> Add VMs
  2. Settings -> Health-probe -> Add health probe
     - E.g. tcp-80-probe (HTTP) probe
     - Set interval -> time between prop events
     - Set unhealth threshold (e.g. 2) before VM is dropped out from the pool
     - Add load balancing port
     - Incoming request from port 80 (*port*) will be passed to TCP passed 80 (*back-end port*)
     - Select backend pool & health-probe
     - Set session persistance
     - Floating IP (direct server return)
       - Use with internal load balancers
       - Use with SQL server always on cluster
       - Used when same back-end port needs to be used across multiple rules in a single Load Balancer.
  3. Add inbound NAT rule
     - Map TCP 5000 to a VMs RDP port (3389)
     - Map TCP 5000 to a VMs RDP port (3389)

## Internal load balancer

- OSI Layer 4 TCP and UDP
- Applies to traffic only within a virtual network
  - No public IP address
- Good for applying load balancing to n-tier application services (database)

## Application Gateway

- OSI Layer 7 application
- Application Delivery Controller (ADC) as a service
- SSL offload
- Has Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Traffic Manager

- DNS-level
- Geographical load balancing
- Offers different routing methods
