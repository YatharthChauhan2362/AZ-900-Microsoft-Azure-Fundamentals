# Deployment

- Deployment tools
  - ‚Ä¢ Azure portal ‚Ä¢ Azure Cloud Shell ‚Ä¢ Azure PowerShell ‚Ä¢¬†Azure CLI ‚Ä¢ Azure SDKs ‚Ä¢ ARM templates
- You can create from
  - User images
    - Uses unmanaged disks
  - Marketplace images

## Create VM Image

### Generalizing VM

- Should be the first step
- Generalization resets server-specific data:
  Computer name
  - Security identifiers (SIDs)
  - Local administrator/root identity
  - Device driver cache
  - Event logs
- How to generalize
  - On Windows use `sysprep`, "System Preparation Tool"
  - On Linux run `sudo waagent -deprovision+user`
  - Take a VM backup first, because generalization is destructive and permanent

### Create VM image from Azure VM

- Managed Disk Concepts
  - Disks
    - No storage account (management) required
    - Pay for pre-allocated storage (P10 =128 GB SSD VHD)
  - Snapshots
    - Read-only full copy of a managed disks
    - You can create new VMs based on snapshots
  - Images
    - Generalized VM disk images
    - Snapshots can be converted into images
- **Flow**
  1. Get an image
     - Get a snapshot image
       1. Go to Disks ‚Üí Select OS disk ‚Üí Create snapshot
       2. In snapshot ‚Üí Click on Export ‚Üí You will get SAS url ‚Üí Download VHD
       3. Generalize the image
     - Or capture an image
       - In portal: VM ‚Üí Overview ‚Üí Capture
       - ‚ùó Not generalized
       - It appears in images
  2. Go to Images in portal, select the image, from there click on Deploy and it'll navigate you

## VM Connection

- You have different levels of security NSG, host firewall, options to have public IP or not

### Just-in-time VM Access

- Allowed by **Azure Defender** (formerly known as **Azure Security Center Standard tier**)
- Locks down all administrator ports as default, when admin requests admin session then session is bounded by time limit and IP address restriction while granting access.
- No need to have management port open all the time
- üí° Recommended to enable

## Deploying Linux Server VM

- Around 40% of workloads in Azure runs on Linux
- Endorsed in Azure: CentOS, CoreOS, Debian, Oracle Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Enterprise Linux, openSUSE, Ubuntu
- Connection
  - **Secure Shell (SSH)**
    - A popular client is PuTTy for SSH or you can install *subsystem for Linux* or *git tools* on Windows 10 to get SSH.
  - **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**
    - You can install RDP on Linux.
    - Some do not believe in graphical shell:
      - Presents security vulnerability possible
      - Needlessly consumes CPU
    - Windows team ported RDP into linux.
  - **Serial Console**
    - COM1 serial port connection to VM
    - Low-level access
    - Helpful when e.g. your VM doesn't boot up
- **Authentication**
  1. SSH Public Key
     - You keep private key and share public key with Azure.
  2. Password
     - You can reset those after deployment in portal: VM ‚Üí Reset password

## Deploying Windows Server VM

- Windows Server 2019, 2016, 2012, 2008, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise (for e.g. load testing, client-side testing, jump-box)
- **Connect**
  - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
    - Uses TCP 3389
    - You can connect directly from Portal: Overview ‚Üí Connect
  - WinRM (PowerShell) Remoting
    - TCP 5985, 5986
  - Serial Console
    - Text console into VM
    - Can get to VMs that can't boot

## Prepare environment with Azure Policy

- **RBAC vs Azure Policy**
  - RBAC
    - Focuses on user actions at different scopes
    - VM Contributor can manage only VM
    - Built-in custom roles
  - Azure Policy
    - Focuses on resource properties during deployment for already existing resources
    - Uses default allow and explicit deny access system
  - Difference
    - You're not going to be able to create VM unless you have read & write abilities by RBAC
    - Azure Policy in contrast constrains what that RBAC can do when she/he attempts to create VM
- Some built-in Azure Policy definitions are e.g. *`allowed locations`*, *`VM SKU`*, *`ensure MMS extension is deployed`*
- You can create also own policies, or initiatives which are collections of policies.
- Examples
  - Policy definition e.g. allowed locations
  - Parameters e.g. select which regions are allowed

## Deploy with ARM templates

- ARM templates are infrastructure as code foundation of automation and DevOps in Azure
- üí° Visual Studio is a good ARM template editor
  - Visual Studio Code can also be used.
- Different ways to work with templates
  1. You can go to Portal ‚Üí Templates ‚Üí Usage existing usages or add a new template
  2. In Visual Studio ‚Üí Cloud ‚Üí Azure Resource Group ‚Üí You can select template location (e.g. GitHub) ‚Üí Select a template
  3. Deploy a VM then in the last step click on "Download template and parameters"
- You can deploy with PowerShell, Cloud Shell, Azure CLI, or directly from Visual Studio
- You can automate deployment actions such as VM access
- Files
  - `azuredeploy.json`
    - Deployment template.
    - Defines resources and property such as `allowedValues`, `defaultValue`
    - You can refactor some values in variables and reuse in the file
    - `copy` element block in deployment script allows you to create e.g. 3 storages.
  - `azuredeploy.parameters.json`
    - Deployment parameters (required for deployment) to deploy `azuredeploy.json`
