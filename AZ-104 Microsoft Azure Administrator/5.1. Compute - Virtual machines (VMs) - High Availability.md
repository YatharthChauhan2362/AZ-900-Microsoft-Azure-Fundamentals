# High Availability

- High Availability = Redundancy
- Layers of availability
  1. Hardware-level availability
     - Handled by Azure
  2. Server-level availability
     - **Availability Sets**
       - Ensures 99.95% SLA for VMs in availability set
       - Provides server level fault tolerance within a single data center within a single region.
       - Availability sets are containers/racks that's called Fault Domains.
       - 2 VMs in same Availability Sets = Azure places those in different availability sets.
       - Update domains are different domains in different availability sets (fault Domains) and your VMs are set in different update domains as well.
         - Protects availability against VM shutdowns because of update failures / hardware shutdowns.
       - ❗ Must assign availability set at VM deployment
       - ❗ Scaling (resizing) requires stopping all VMs in the availability set.
       - For single VM not in availability set you have 99.9% availability if you use premium storage.
  3. Datacenter-level
     - **Availability Zones**
       - Allows you to place redundant VMs in different regions.
       - Provides data center level tolerance.
       - Load balancers are availability zone aware on standard SKU
       - ❗ You have to use managed disks
  4. Region-level
     - You need recovery service vault (storage for back-ups/replications)
       - **VM backup**
         - Ad-hoc or scheduled
         - Includes all disks and configurations
       - **Azure Site Recovery**
         - **Failover recovery**
           - 15 minute RPO (recovery point objective)
           - **Azure-to-Azure (A2A) ASR Architecture**
             - Directly available in VM blade
             - All storage data, VMs, disks (managed and unmanaged), subnets etc.
               - Prepared and ready to go in another region.
               - In sync
               - ❗ May require configuration with IP addresses
               - You can failover to it and/or failback
           - Configure in VM blade -> Disaster recovery
             - Allows you to configure disaster recovery for single VM
               - For workloads including multiple VMs you should configure it directly from Site Recovery
             - You can choose to automate what happens using Automation runbooks.
             - You can then view recovery status in same blade
               - Replication health
               - Recovery points
                 - Crash-consistent:
                   - Least preferable
                   - As if VM is replicate while it was powered off, no guarantees
                 - App-consistent
                   - Preferable point to recover
                   - Data and OS back
               - Commit -> Finalizes the failover
               - Re-protected -> Creates new recovery environment from old recovery environment (which becomes source environment)
         - **Migration to Azure**
           - On-premises to Azure
           - AWS to Azure

## Azure Advisor

- Gives recommendation regarding high availability
- E.g.:
  - Add more virtual machines for improved fault tolerance *(medium impact)*
  - Enable VM backup to protect your data from corruption and accidental deletion *(medium impact)*
  - Create an Azure service health alert *(low impact)*

## VM Events

- Planned maintenance events
- Unexpected downtime events
- Notification
  - In Azure support webpage, status webpage, twitter account
  - Administrators get e-mail notifications
