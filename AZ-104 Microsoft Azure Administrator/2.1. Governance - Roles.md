## Classic Administrator Roles

- The account that is used to sign up for Azure is automatically set as both the *Account Administrator* and *Service Administrator*.
  - Roles are properties that can be changed in Subcription blade
- üí° Azure recommends using RBAC roles
- **Account Administrator** (1 per Azure account)
  - Conceptually, the billing owner of the subscription.
  - The Account Administrator has no access to the Azure portal.
- **Service Administrator** (1 per Azure subscription)
  - By default, for a new subscription, the Account Administrator is also the Service Administrator.
  - The Service Administrator has the equivalent access of a user who is assigned the Owner role at the subscription scope.
  - The Service Administrator has full access to the Azure portal.
- **Co-Administrator** (200 per subscription)
  - The Co-Administrator has the equivalent access of a user who is assigned the Owner role at the subscription scope.
