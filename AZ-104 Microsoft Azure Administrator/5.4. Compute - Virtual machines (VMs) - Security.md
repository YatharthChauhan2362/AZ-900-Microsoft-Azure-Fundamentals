# Security

## Role based access control

- Provides fine-grained access to resources
- AAA
  - A: Authentication (identity)
  - A: Authorization (abilities)
  - A: Accounting (auditing)
- Higher to lower granularity
  - Management groups â†’ Subscription â†’ Resource group â†’ Resource
- Roles
  - **Reader**: Observers
  - Resource-specific or custom role, **contributor**: Users managing resources
  - **Owner**: Admins
- Custom roles are defined in JSON
- RBAC focuses on user actions at different scopes.
  - By contrast, Azure Policy focuses on resource properties during deployment
    - Policies e.g. *`Allowed virtual machine SKUs`*, *`Enforce automatic OS upgrade with app health checks on VMSS`*
- You can manage in *Access Control (IAM)* blade.

## Storage Security

### Storage Service Encryption

- Protects data at rest in storage account
- 128-bit AES encryption
- Azure manages encryption keys
  - ðŸ’¡ You can manage them yourself with Azure Key Vault

### Azure Disk Encryption

- BitLocker for Windows Server VMs
- DM-Crypt library for Linux VMs
- Protects OS and data disks
- Azure- or customer- managed disks
- Manage:
  - In VM blade -> Disks -> Add data disk
  - Use PowerShell
    1. Create key vault and vault key
    2. Create security principal (identity in Azure AD) that can take the key from key vault
    3. You run `SetRmVMDiskEncryption` to configure encryption

## Network-level security

### Network Security Group (NSG)

- Stateful firewalls
- Augmented security rules: Have inbound/outbound rules
- Can be bound to *public addresses*, *load balancers*, *subnets* and *VM*s.
- Traffic streams are identified with 5-tuple hash: Source, destination, port, protocol, IP addresses.
- Source can be service tags
  - In-built e.g. Internet
- Or custom (**Application Security Group** identifiers)
  - Simplifies NSGs
  - Logically groups VMs e.g. by role
    - Association is done through NICs
  - E.g. AppServers, DatabaseServers
  - Flow:
    1. Define ASGs
    2. Include ASGs in NSGs

### Host Firewalls

- E.g. Windows Defender Firewall on Windows Server VMs
- ðŸ’¡ A range that's whitelisted in NSG can be blocked by host firewalls.

### Jumpbox Architecture

- Jumpbox is a pivot point VM in a VNet
- Good for auditing every administrative action
  - A shared jumpbox makes it easier to administrate the orchestration
- You can e.g. allow access to public IP and make sure it's locked down to that endpoint.
- Or you can e.g. point to Site-to-Site VPN or point-to-site VPN.

## Azure Security Center (ACS)

- Two tiers: [Azure Security Center Free Tier](#azure-security-center-free-tier), [Azure Defender](#azure-defender)
- See also [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/details/security-center/)

### Azure Security Center Free Tier

- Continuous security assessment
- Actionable recommendations
- Prioritized alerts and incidents
- Integrated security solutions
  - E.g. recommends to deploy WAF

### Azure Defender

- [Just-in-time VM Access](#just-in-time-jit-vm-access)
- Threat protection for Azure VMs and non-Azure servers
- Threat protection for PaaS services
- Regulatory compliance dashboard and reports

#### Just-in-Time (JIT) VM Access

- Allowed by **Azure Defender for servers** (formerly known as **Azure Security Center Standard tier**)
- Normally to access a VM, you need 3389 for RDP protocol, or 22 to SSH for linux, you open those ports 7/24.
  - Not so secure as they're publicly accessible if IP is public.
- JIT locks down inbound administrative port access
- Time-restricted access to specific IP address(es)
