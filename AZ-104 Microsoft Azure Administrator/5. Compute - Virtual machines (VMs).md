# Virtual Machines (VMs)

## Concepts

- Storage resource provider (SRP)
  - Disks (blob)
  - Storage account
- Compute resource provider (CRP)
  - VMs
- Networking resource provider (NRP)
  - NICs, IP addresses, subnets load balancers..

## Common VM Operations

### Moving a VM

- Helps for
  - high availability
  - reduce latency for serving from VMs closer to users
- 💡 You can move virtual machines with the managed disks & in Availability Zones across subscriptions and VMs.
  - ❗ Not supported:
    - Virtual Machine Scale Sets.
    - Virtual machines created from Marketplace resources with plans attached
- ❗ To move a virtual machine with a network interface card, you must move all dependent resources.
  - E.g. • virtual network for the network interface card • all other network interface cards for the virtual network • VPN gateways
- Virtual networks (classic) can't be moved.
- Can move across regions using
  - [Azure Resource Mover](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/resource-mover/overview)
  - Using Azure Site Recovery by copying the data

### Stopping a VM

- **Deallocation**
  - ❗ If you shut down a VM inside VM, Azure still keeps the resources
    - 💡 Deallocate instead
- **Auto shutdown**
  - VM blade in Portal

### Removing a VM*

- Deleting VM doesn't remove dependencies such as NICs, storages, OS/data disks, IP addresses
- 💡 Delete resource group instead, or use taxonomic tags
- PowerShell or CLI allows you to keep OS and/or Data disks

## Azure VM Extensions

- Extends VM capabilities
- Requires Azure VM Agent (different for Windows or Linux)
  - Marketplace images already have it
  - For lift & shift, install agent first before uploading to cloud
- **VM Access**
  - Backdoor to reset VM password reset
  - Allows to modify RDP/SSH configurations
- **VM Backup**
  - Allows to back-up VMs and configurations to recovery vault
- **Custom Script**
  - Allows Desired State Configuration (DSC)
    - You can script in Linux (bash), Windows (PowerShell)
    - Puppet, chef etc
- **Microsoft Monitoring Agent**
  - Onboards VM in Log Analytics

## Sizing

- Allows vertical scaling, e.g. CPU, RAM and other resources
- ❗ Resizing requires rebooting VM.
- **Azure Compute Unit (ACU)**
  - Standardization without any hardware details
  - 100 ACU = Small (Standard A1) VM
    - A = Family
    - 1 = Size (versioned)
  - DS_V3 = 160-190 ACU
  - Good for estimating for lift and shift.
  - As you raise ACU, per minute runtime charges increases.
- Types

  | Type | Sizes | Description |
  | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
  | General purpose | B, Dsv3, Dv3, DSv2, Dv2, DS, D, Av2, A0-7 | Balanced CPU-to-memory ratio. Ideal for testing and development, small to medium databases, and low medium traffic web servers. |
  | Compute optimized | Fsv2, Fs, F | High CPU-to-memory ratio. Good for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers. |
  | Memory optimized | Esv3, Ev3, M, GS, G, DSv2, DS, Dv2, D | High memory-to-CPU ratio. Great for relational database servers, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics. |
  | Storage optimized | Ls | High disk throughput and IO. Ideal for Big Data, SQL and NoSQL databases. |
  | GPU | NV, NC, NCv2, NCv3, ND | Specialized virtual machines targeted for heavy graphic rendering and viedo editing, as well as model training and inferencing (ND) with deep learning. Available with single or multiple GPUs |
  | High performance compute | H, A8-11 | Our fastest and most powerful CPU virtual machines with high-throughput network interfaces (RDMA). |

## Disk Types

- **OS Disk**
  - ❗ Generation 1. VHD only
    - If you use Generation 2 Hyper-V you need to convert from `.vhdx` to `.vhd`.
  - Registered as SATA drive
  - ❗ Maximum capacity of 1 TB
- **Data Disk**
  - Dependent # on VM instance size
  - Registered as SCSI disk
  - ❗ Max capacity 4 TB
- **Temprorary Disk**
  - D: or /dev/sdb1
  - Bound to the hardware host
  - Do not store permanent data!

## Storage

### Standard vs. Premium Disk Storage

- **Standard Disks**
  - Backed by cost-effective HDDs
  - High availability: several replication options
  - Stored in Azure storage account
  - Standard SSD available for managed disks (dev/test/entry elvel production applications)
  - Standard storage provides maximum IOPS values for each VHD
  - On portal
    - You can see disks in Azure Disks.
    - Azure names managed disks like `dc1_data-disk1`, `dc1_OSDisk` for a VM named `dc`.
    - By clicking on it, you can manage the disk.
      - You can e.g. export, create a snapshot
- **Premium Disks**
  - Backed by high-speed SSDs
  - IOPS values are predictable, expected performance levels
  - Pre-pay for all storage used (fixed sized disk sizes)
    - 💡 Predictable speed and IOPS
    - P10, 128 GB, 500 IOPs, 50 MB/sec
  - ❗ Supports only Generation 1 VHD
    - If you use Generation 2 Hyper-V you need to convert from `.vhdx` to `.vhd`.
    - 💡 Azure Site Recovery migration handles this automatically
    - On portal
      - You can see unmanaged disks in Blob Containers → VHDs → you see VHDs
      - A security problem is that someone by mistake can give public access to the blobs in the storage account.

### Managed vs. unmanaged Disk Storage

- **Unmanaged Disks**
  - Original method to store VM VHDS
    - Legacy
  - VHDS are stored as page blobs in an Azure storage account
  - ❗ Maximum 256 TB of storage per VM
  - ❗ You need to manage storage account availability
  - ❗ 20,000 IOPS limit across all VM disks in a standard storage account
  - In storage account they're in Blob Containers → VHDS container.
    - They're leased
      - They a re locked
      - You need to stop & deallocate VMs to delete them
    - You can break lease in Storage Explorer by right clicking
- **Managed Disks**
  - 💡 Always use
  - Azure manages the disks, you don't have to worry about storage account-level IOPS restrictions.
  - Pre-pay for disk size (no need for SA)
    - S10, 128 GB, 500 IOPS, 60 MB/sec
  - Supports Standard and Premium SSD and Standard HDD
  - ❗ LRS replication only for Premium managed disks
  - ❗ You can resize only when they're unattached or owner VM is stopped & deallocated

## Costs

- Use [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)
- Optimizing costs
  - 💡 Reserved Virtual Instances are the cheapest option.
    - You pay 1 to 3 year term for a particular VM instance size in aspecific region.
  - 💡 Reuse on-prem Microsoft licensens, up to 49% discount
- VM Chooser (`azurevmchooser.kvaes.be`)
  - Open source applications to get recommendations
    1. Give total VCPUs, RAMs etc.
    2. Select a recommended VM
    3. VM optimizer: Choose usage patterns, region etc.

## IP addressing

- You always have a private IP and you can optionally have a public IP
- **Public IP addresses**
  - Best practice is to never have a public IP
    - Consider a load balancer to map the private IP.
  - First 5 public IPs are free then it costs
  - You have to NSG with an public IP
  - Public IPv4 addresses can be associated with:
    - VM vNICs, public load balancers, VPN gateways, and application gateways
  - Public IP Address SKUs
    - Basic SKU
      - Open by default
      - Static or dynamic allocation
    - Standard SKU
      - Secure by default (NSG)
      - Static allocation only
      - HA: Availability zone aware, can span to different availability zones
- **DNS Naming**
  - For VMs you can configure & use host name
  - VM -> Overview -> Configure DNS Name then you can have like `somename.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com`

## Monitoring

### Boot Diagnostics

- Periodic screenshots of the console
- Enables serial console
  - You can connect to VM when you can't SSH/RDP for fixing e.g. boot state
  - Requires you to have VM Contributor or higher privileges.
  - No need to open SSH/RDP ports

### Guest OS diagnostics

- Requires storage account
- Event logs, performence counters etc.
- Lowest level IaaS monitoring extension
- For more diagnostics:
  - Windows: AzurePerformanceDiagnostics
  - Linux: Linux Diagnostic Extension (LAD) 3.0

### Azure Log Analytics

- Enabled by deploying the Microsoft Management Extension
- Onboards VMs into Log Analytics workspace

### System Center Operations Manager (SCOM)

- Hybrid cloud approach
- You can track your cloud VMs on on-premises or visa versa
