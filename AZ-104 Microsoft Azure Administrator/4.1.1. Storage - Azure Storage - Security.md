# Azure Storage Account Security

## Management vs Data Plane

- Handled with RBAC in Azure AD
  - Can see storage keys: Owner, Contributor & Storage Account,Virtual Machine Contributor, Storage Account Key Operator Service
    - Reader cannot see storage keys

### Management Plane

- Administrative tasks e.g.
  - Viewing properties of storage account.
  - Deleting storage account.
  - Assigning roles to other users.
  - Modifying the configuration.

### Data Plane

- Requires access to storage account keys.
- On blobs you can set access level to public access.

#### Storage Account Keys**

- Provides full access to the storage
- üí° Best practice: Give all admins and apps same key.
  - Enables you to:
    - Regenerate secondary key.
    - Update apps to use secondary key
    - Regenerate primary key
- Can be managed by Azure Key Vault using Powershell
  - Storage account keys are stored as Key vault secrets.
  - Azure Key Vault syncs keys with storage Account
  - Storage account keys never returned to caller.

#### Shared Access Signatures (SAS tokens)

- üí° Better as it follows principle of the least privilege.
- Contains permissions and start & end validity period.
  - Set read and/or write permissions.
  - Grant permissions to access only partition + row key ranges.
  - You can restrict access to IP Address(es)
  - Enforce HTTPS
- Two types:
  - ***Service Level SAS***: Only to a single blob/file/table or queue storage.
  - ***Account Level SAS***: Applies to multiple services
- ‚ùó It's generated by client and is not tracked by Microsoft.
  - Signature is signed with account key and ensures none of the parameters are tempered.
  - To invalidate, you'll need to regenerate storage account key used to sign SAS.
  - üí° Better way: **Storage Access Policies**
    - Defined on container level.
      - In portal: Containers ‚Üí Right click on container ‚Üí Access policy
    - Permissions + validity period is on server side.
    - Service level SAS only.
    - Easy to revoke by deleting the policy or changing its validity period.
- Example url:

  | URL part | Description |
  | -------- | ----------- |
  |`https://myacount.blob.core.windows.net/container1/file1.pdf` | URL to endpoint |
  | `?sv=2017-07-29` | Rest API version |
  | `&st=2018-04-30T19%3A19%3A19Z` | Validity start time |
  | `&se=2018-05-01T19%3A19%#A19Z` | Validity end time |
  | `&sr=b` | Type of resource |
  | `&sp=r` | Permissions |
  | `&sip=168.1.5.60-168.1.5.70` | IP Address / range *(optional)* |
  | `&spr=https` | Protocol *(optional)* |
  | `&sig=pk9oGEPqYyu0K4Gutfreq9n0CJqgnjYgkEwcIEL8I0%3D` | Signature |

#### Azure AD authentication with RBAC

- Available for Blob and Queue services.
- Azure AD provides OAuth 2.0 token
- E.g. *Storage Blob Data Contributor*, *Storage Blob Data Reader*, *Storage Queue Data Contributor*, *Storage Queue Data Reader*
- Subscription level (for all Storage Accounts), Resource group level, Storage level or Blob container/queue level.
- For users, groups, applications, managed service identities.
- You register your application in AD (App Registrations)
  - You can then assign roles to your application.
  - Roles can also be assigned to **Managed Service Identity (MSI)**
    - Can set up with Azure VMs, Function Apps, VM Scale Sets
    - Credentials are injected into service instance (e.g. client id and certificate)
    - Code calls local MSI endpoint to authenticate to the resource (e.g. storage)
- Easier management, no need to handle SAS tokens or manage keys.

### Encrypt data in transit

- Enforced by enabling **Secure Transfer**
  - Requires HTTPS for REST API
  - Requires SMB 3.0 for Azure file service
- When moving data e.g. between
  - Azure regions
  - On-prem to Azure storage
    - You can use Site-to-Site VPN, Point-to-Site VPN or Azure ExpressRoute.
- The data is moved across internet.
- üí° Vulnerable to Azure, good to encrypt data.
  - Configuration from outside Storage Account always requires SMB 3.0
  - SMB 2.1 does not have encryption so it's only allowed between different Azure regions.
  - *Secure transfer required* option is disabled by default.
- SAS tokens can specify only HTTPS can be used.
- You can also use **client side encryption**
  - Encrypt data within the application.
  - Double encrypted as Azure storage encrypts data as default.
  - Still good idea to enforce HTTPS
    - HTTPS has built-in integrity checks to avoid network data loss
  - There are SDKS for e.g. C#, JAVA.
  - Can leverage Azure Key vault to generate and/or store keys.

### Encrypt data in rest

- Every storage account has encryption enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
- Required for many compliances e.g. privacy.

#### Storage Service Encryption (SSE)

- Encrypts data before it's written
- Decrypts data before it's read
- Allows you to get encryption without any code
- Applies to Standard and Premium.
- Uses 256 bit AES.
- Keys are managed by Microsoft by default.
- Allows you to use your own encryption keys.
  - ‚ùó Blobs and files only.
  - ‚ùó Can only enable after the account is created.
  - ‚ùó Key vault and storage account must be in same region
    - Can be in different subscriptions

#### Azure Disk Encryption

- Encrypts data disks (VHD) of VMs.
- Handles both managed & unmanaged disks.
- Windows VMs: BitLocker encryption
- Linux VMs: DM-crypt
- Integrates with Key Vault to manage keys.
  - ‚ùó Key Vault must reside in same region and subscription
  - When uploading encrypted VM, you can upload encryption keys to Azure Key Vault first.
    - Good for migrating as you can use same keys as on-premises.

### Configure network

- By default, storage accounts are accessible by all networks including internet
- Allows you to create trust boundaries
- Setting up networking/firewall rule
  - ‚ùó Denies all traffic by default unless any connection are explicitly opened
- In portal: Settings ‚Üí Firewalls and Virtual Networks ‚ÜíSelect Network
- You can have VNets from the same region as storage account or in a paired region.
- **Firewall** allows you to choose IP addresses that can access VMs
  - E.g. you can set up only ExpressRoute access.
- When you configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks
