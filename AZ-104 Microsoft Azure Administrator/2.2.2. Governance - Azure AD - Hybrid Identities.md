# Hybrid Identities

- Hybrid (common) identity = Cloud + On Premises identity
- Connection is done through Azure AD connect

## Four Pillars

- **Unified Development and DevOps**
  - A common approach to building applications, and full flexibility to deploy in the cloud or on-premises
- **Integrated management and security**
  - Built-in management and security solutions across full operational lifecycle from cloud to on-premises
- **Common Identity**
  - Enable end-user productivity with single sign on to cloud and on premises applications while protecting corporate data
  - **Single identity**
    - Create and manage a single identity for each user across your hybrid enterprise, keeping users, groups and devices in sync
  - **Single Sign-on**
    - Provide single sign-on access to your application including thousands of pre-integrated SaaS apps
  - **Conditional Access**
    - Protect identities by enforcing risk-based conditional access policies and multi-factor authentication for both on-premises and cloud applications
  - **Remote Access**
    - Provide secure remote access to on-premises web applications through Azure AD **Application Proxy**
  - **Self Service**
    - Self service password reset and application access requests for directories in the datacenter an the cloud
  - **High Availability**
  - **Collaboration**
    - Enable vendors, contractors and partners to get risk-free access to in-house resources
  - **Consistency**
    - Truly consistent capabilities
- **Consistent Data Platform**
  - Seamlessly distribute data between cloud and on-premises
  - Enrich with analysis and deep learning

## Azure AD Connect

- Integrate your on-premises AD or LDAP directory to the cloud
- Establish a single identity for your us ers to access on-premises and cloud-based resources
- Connect your users to thousands of SaaS applications published through Azure
- Manage in Azure AD Connect ‚Üí Synchronization Service
- Adjust to business changes after Azure AD Connect is installed.
- Change the service accounts
- Add the **Managers** OU to be included in the synchronization

### Preparing for Azure AD Connect

- Create a new user in Azure AD as Global Administrator
- Download Azure AD Connect and install it.
  - You need > Windows Server 2008

### Install and configure Azure AD Connect

- Installation settings
  - **Initially**
    - Custom or Express installation
    - Installation location
    - Create an express SQL or use an existing SQL instance
    - Provide a service account or create a new one
      - Service account for SQL server
    - Custom sync groups
      - Fill: Administrators group, operators group, browser group, password reset groups
      - AD Connect groups not domain groups!
  - **Then**
    - **How users will sign-in**
      - One of them: *Password synchronization*, *Pass-through authentication*, *Federation with AD FS*
      - *Enable sign on* ‚Üí Yes, No
    - **Forest and Azure credentials**
      - *Global administration username password*
      - *Select directory type (AD or LDAP)*
        - Then type *Forest name*
      - *Create new AD account* or *use existing AD account*
      - Type *domain username and password*
        - üí° Recommended to enter Enterprise Admin credentials
    - **Select UPN for sign-in**
      - E.g. `azure-contoso.com`
      - Select user name: e.g. `userPrincipalName`, `treeName`, `unicodePwd`
  - **Then**
    - **Choose what domains and OUs get synchronized to the cloud**
      - *Sync all domains* and OUs or *sync selected domains and OUs*
    - **How to uniquely identify users**
      - Identification:
        1. *Users are represented only once across all directories*.
        2. *User identities exist across multiple directories*.
           - Match using: mail attribute, specific attribute, etc.
      - Source anchor (ID)
        1. *Let Azure manage the source anchor for me*
        2. *Specific attribute*: objectGUID, pager, objectSid etc.
    - **Filter users and devices by group**
      1. *Synchronize all users and devices*
      2. *Synchronize selected*
    - **Optional features**
      - Exchange hybrid deployment
      - Exchange mail public folders
      - Azure AD app and attribute filtering
      - Password synchronization
      - Password writeback
      - Group writeback
      - Device writeback
      - Directory extension attribute sync.
    - **Enable single sign on**
      - ‚ùó Requires domain administrator account
    - **Choose staging mode or install it**
      - **Staging mode**: Synchronization won't synchronize any data to Azure AD
  - **Post installation**
    - Install AzureAD powershell module
    - üí° Then enable Azure AD recycle bin

### Metaverse

- What'll be synced in the next synchronization
  - Connectors to and from on-premises Active Directory
  - Connectors to and from Azure Active Directory
- Controls what attributes from what objects from what location are available for synchronization

## Hybrid Planning

### Sign On

- **Authentication and Authorization**
  - *How do users typically login to their on-premises environment?*
  - *How will users sign-on to the cloud?*
  - *Will you be allowing workers from partner networks access to cl oud and on-premises resources?*
- **Multi Factor Authentication**
  - *Do you currently implement multi-factor authentication?*
  - *What are the key scenarios that you want to enable MFA for?*
  - *Will you use MFA to secure Microsoft Apps?*
  - *Will you use MFA to secure remote access to on-premises apps?*
- **Delegation and Administration**
  - *Does your company have more than one user with elevated privilege to manage your identity system?*
  - *Does your company need to delegate access to users to manage specific resources?*
  - *Does each delegated user need the same access?*

### Synchronization

- **Directory synchronization**
  - *Do you have a disaster recovery plan for the synchronization server?*
  - *Where will the synchronization server be located?*
    - E.g. if it's behind a firewall, you'll need to open up some ports
  - *Do you have any other directory on-premises like LDAP or an HR database?*
  - *Does your company use Microsoft Exchange?*
- **Multi Forest synchronization**
  - *Are the UPNs unique in your organization?*
    - More than one forest ‚Üí You can call people same thing as other people ‚Üí You won't be able to do that in single Azure AD as they need unique UPNs.
  - *Will the Azure AD Connect server be able to get to each forest?*
  - *Do you have an account with the correct permissions for all forests you want to synchronize with?*
- **Password synchronization**
  - *Do you have restrictions on storing passwords in the cloud?*
  - *Will your employees be able to reset their own passwords?*
  - *What account lockout policy does your company require?

### Applications

- **Applications**
  - *Will users be accessing on-premises applications? In the cloud? Or both?*
  - *Are there plans to develop new applications that will use cloud authentications?*
    - If so, then make sure that authentication can use OAuth, certificates e.t.c.
  - *Will cloud users be accessing applications on-premises?*
  - *Will on-premises users be accessing applications in the cloud?*
- **Access Control**
  - *Does your a company need to limit access to resources according to some conditions?*
  - *Does your company have any application that needs custom control access to some resources?*
  - *Does your company need to integrate access control capabilities between on-premises and cloud resources?*
  - *Does each user need the same access level?*

### Domain Structure

- **Domain Name**
  - *What name will your organization use for your domain in the cloud?*
  - *Does your organization have a custom domain name?*
  - *Is your domain public and easily verifiable via DNS?*
- **Directory Structure**
  - *How many AD forests do you have?*
  - *How many Azure AD directories?*
  - *Will you filter what user accounts are synchronized with the Azure AD?*
  - *Do you have multiple Azure AD Connect servers planned?*
  - *Do you have different directory that users authenticate against?*
- **Federation**
  - *Will you use the Azure Federation or on-premises AD FS?*
    - An option is moving on-premises AD FS to Azure Federation.
  - *More federation services for identities are provided now through Azure*
  - *Does your organization use smart cards for Multi Factor Authentication*

## Forest to Azure AD Topology

- ‚ùó Restrictions
  - One to one relation between Azure AD and AD Connect
    - Multiple AD Connect can not connect to Single azure AD
    - Azure AD Connect cannot connect to multiple Azure AD directories
  - The same user account cannot sync to multiple Azure AD directories
  - Users in one Azure AD cannot appear as contacts in another Azure AD directory
- **Single Forest to Single Azure AD**
  - *Single Forest ‚Üí Single AD Connect ‚Üí One Multiple AD*
  - Most common topology
  - üí° Recommended by Microsoft
  - Expected topology when using Azure AD Connect Express installation
  - Supports multiple domains
- **Single Forest to Multiple Azure AD**
  - *Single Forest ‚Üí Multiple AD Connects ‚Üí One Multiple AD*
  - Useful when e.g. some users passwords cannot be written back to the cloud but another department can do it.
  - ‚ùó Azure AD Connect sync servers must be configured for mutually exclusive filtering.
  - ‚ùó Users in one Azure AD will only be able to see users from their own Azure AD instance.
  - ‚ùó A DNS domain can only be registered in a single Azure AD directory.
  - ‚ùó Some write-back features not supported with this topology
    - No group / device writeback
- **Multiple Forest to Single Azure AD**
  - *Multiple Forest ‚Üí One AD Connect ‚Üí One Azure AD*
  - ‚ùó Users must have only one identity across all forests
  - The user authenticates to the forest in which their identity is located.
  - All forests are accessible by Azure AD Connect
  - ‚ùó Users have only one mailbox
- **Multiple Forest to Multiple Azure AD**
  - *Multiple Forest ‚Üí Multiple AD Connects ‚Üí Multiple Azure ADs*
  - Useful especially if you need isolation for different forests.
  - For each instance of Azure AD, you'll need an installation of Azure AD Connect
  - Users in one Azure AD will only be able to see users from their AAD instance.

## Register domain name

- ***Add Azure AD Domain Name***
  - Create directory where organization name is `contoso.local`.
  - Add domain name `azure-contoso.com` and verify through TXT DNS entry.
- ***Add UPN Suffix***
  - On-prem resources has `name@contoso.local` but you'll need `name@azure-contoso.com` to allow e.g. SSO.
  - Flow:
    1. Add `azure-contoso.com` as an alternative UPN Suffix through Active Directory Domains and Trusts
    2. Add `azure-contoso.com` to all user accounts as the preferred UPN suffix.

## Single Sign On

- **Password synchronization**
  - A copy of password and usernames is synchronized to the cloud.
- **Pass through authentication**
  - You don't store passwords in cloud
  - User is authenticated using pass through authentication agent that connects with on-premises AD
  - Works seamlessly with Azure Multi-Factor authentication
- **Seamless SSO**
  - Works with Azure AD Join or the desktop is previously joined to your AD domain
  - Requires Azure service endpoints to be added to the client browser's Intranet zone.
    - This way the browser can send the Kerberos ticket to the website.
  - Flow:
    1. Client from a joined device tries to access to a resource in cloud.
    2. Local client goes to AD DC and gets an access token.
    3. Client forwards access token to Azure AD.
       - If MFA is enabled, it'll prompt user.

## Making cloud apps available

- Cloud apps are registered as [Enterprise Application](./2.2.1.%20Governance%20-%20Azure%20AD%20-%20Entities.md#Enterprise-Application)
- Configured in portal
  - Azure AD ‚Üí Enterprise Applications
  - 4 categories
    1. Gallery applications
    2. Applications you're developing, integrated with Azure AD
    3. On-premises applications with Azure AD Application Proxy
       - **Azure AD Application Proxy**
         - Allows Azure to reach on-premises resources.
         - Consistent access to private resources without a VPN.
         - Install App Proxy & Connector on-premises
           - ‚ùó Cannot be installed on a server with the Pass Through Authentication connector
           - ‚ùó You need to configure a CNAME on DNS for the particular domain work for it to work.
         - Set-up on Azure
           - Add applications
           - Assign to users
           - Configure SSO
           - Provision just like any SaaS app
         - Flow for Azure user reaching on-premises resource:
           1. Azure AD gives a token to user
           2. User sends that token to Azure App Proxy
           3. Proxy takes UPN and SPN and gives it to connector
           4. Connector goes to on-prem AD and gets Kerberos ticket.
           5. It forwards it to actual on-prem application, it verifies the ticket and ticket is assigned to the cloud user.
    4. Non-gallery applications
- Manage permission
  - Azure AD ‚Üí Enterprise Applications ‚Üí In application ‚Üí Users and groups
- Configure SSO
  1. Configure SSO for the new application
     - Manage permission
       - Azure AD ‚Üí Enterprise Applications ‚Üí In application ‚Üí Single sign-on
     - Sign-on types:
       - Password-based Sign-on
       - Linked Sign-on
       - SAML
         - Provides step by step guide for federation between application and Azure AD manually
  2. Click on the new application new in the Azure AD MyApps access panel
     - Access panel is reached at `myapps.microsoft.com`
     - It prompts you to install a browser extension
  3. Install Access Panel Extension
  4. Log into application so that password is stored for SSO
