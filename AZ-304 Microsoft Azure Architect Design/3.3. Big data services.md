# Big data services

## Azure Search

- PaaS / Search as a Service over scoped text content.
- Stores your data in an index that can be searched through full text queries.
  - Can be created in Azure Portal or with SDK/REST APIs.
  - Can be auto-generated from SQL Database or Cosmos DB.
- Search is not only indexing!
  - Search needs to be smarter, have language understanding, understand uniqueness.
- Advanced search behaviors
  - Type-ahead query suggestions based on partial term input
  - Hit-highlighting
  - Faceted navigation
  - Natural language support using linguistic rules for the specified language.
- **Pricing**
  - Free: Shared with other Azure Search subscribers
  - Higher
    - Dedicated resources only used by your service
    - More search units & partitions
      - **Search unit**
        - How fast it indexes
          - Each partition and replica counts as one SU
          - E.g. 3 replicas + 3 partitions = 9 SU (as each partition have its own replica)

## Azure Cosmos DB

- Multi-model database service.
- Globally distributed: users access data centers closer to them.
- Four different APIs:
  - Document DB (SQL) API,
  - MongoDB API
  - Graph (Gremlin) API
  - Tables (Key/Value) API
- **The Azure Cosmos DB Data Migration tool**
  - Open-source solution that imports data to Azure Cosmos DB
  - Sources, include: JSON files, MongoDB, SQL Server, CSV files, Azure Cosmos DB collections.

### Consistency levels

- Automatic data distribution across partitions.
- Same partition key ensures data will be stored within same partition.
- 📝 **Consistent-prefix**
  - Data versions can be behind by are always ordered in a right way based on when they're written.
- Four consistency levels from stronger guarantees to better performance and availability:
- From strongest to loosest: Strong => Bounded Stateless => Session => Eventual
- Consistency strategy
  - Stronger consistency -> Write is slower
  - Looser -> Performance is at peak but read can lag behind to older versions of data

#### Strong

- Write operation on primary database => it's replicated to the replica instances.
- The operation is only committed (and visible) on the primary after it has been committed and confirmed by ALL replicas.
- Always read most recent copy from master r/w node.

#### Bounded Stateless

- Reads honor consistent-prefix guarantee.
- Established through 2 metrics: time/version.
  - E.g. goal: 90%>
- Difference from Strong is you can configure how stale documents can be within replicas.
  - ***Staleness*** : Quantity of time (or version count) a replica document can be behind the primary document.

#### Session

- Reads honor consistent-prefix guarantee.
- Guarantees all queries are served by same server per session.
  - You always see the latest change you make.
- All read & write are consistent & monotonic across primary and replica instances within a user session.

#### Eventual

- Commits any write operation against the primary immediately.
- Transactions are handled asynchronously and will eventually (over time) be consistent with the primary.
- Most performant as you don't wait for replicas to commit to finalize its transactions.

## Azure Synapse Analytics

- Cloud-based Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)
- Formerly known as **SQL Data Warehouse**.
- Main difference from SQL is that it's underlying infrastructure is that it's a ***columnar storage***.
  - Tables are still relational
- Quickly run complex queries across petabytes of data.
  - Leverages Massively Parallel Processing (MPP).
- E.g. use as a key component of a big data solution.
- Supports **PolyBase T-SQL queries**
  - PolyBase is a technology that accesses and combines both non-relational and relational data, all from within SQL Server.
  - It allows you to run queries on external data in Hadoop/Spark or Azure blob storage.
- 💡 Choose if you run many aggregated queries.
- Data flow
  - **Ingest**: Data orchestration and monitoring
  - **Store**: Big data store
  - **Prep & train**: Hadoop/Spark and Machine Learning
  - **Model & serve**: Data warehouse

## Azure Data Lake Store

- Hyper-scale repository for big data analytic workloads.
- Stores data of any size, type and ingestion speed in a one single place for operational and exploratory analytics.
- It's a distributed file system
- Can be accessed from Hadoop (available with HDInsight cluster) using the WebHDFS-compatible REST APIs.
  - **WebHDFS** => *Web Hadoop File System* for IaaS.
    - Used also by Kafka.
  - **HDInsight**
    - Compute layer of the data lake store.
    - Managed hadoop cluster
- Includes security (e.g. OAuth, 777), manageability, scalability, reliability and availability.

### File systems

- **Single machine**: Fat NFS
- **Network file-systems**: NFS, SMB
  - Distributed lock.
  - Different nodes can mount same drive without corruption.
- **Cluster file-systems**: ZFS, ADFS, Oracle RAC
  - They respect each others lock.
  - Allows multiple machines to manipulate files within them concurrently.
  - Oracle RAC is ***active-active***.
    - Machines share their caches.
    - They cross replicates to create illusion that they're active nodes, but the reality is that there's a single master node.
      - If master node fails -> mastership is delegated to another node.
- **Distributed file system**
  - Connects machines.
  - Instead of everyone mounting a shared device -> Every machine has a local storage and distributed across others.
  - Allows distributing jobs so it can be distributed.
    - Parallel processing, e.g. Hadoop.
  - It's not much about distributing files but parallel processing.
- **More**, e.g. storage based on blockchain.

## Azure Data Lake Analytics

- Biggest challenge of Hadoop is that it's a very big ecosystem.
  - So many components, hard to get stuff done.
- Simplify big data analytics.
- Can handle jobs of any scale instantly by setting the dial for how much power you need.
- Pay only for your job when it is running, making it cost-effective.
- The analytics service supports Azure Active Directory letting you manage access and roles, integrated with your on-premises identity system.
- Includes **U-SQL**
  - Similar to C# and SQL.
  - A language that unifies the benefits of SQL with the expressive power of user code.
  - Scalable distributed runtime enables you to efficiently analyze data in the store and across SQL Servers in Azure, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

## Azure Data Factory

- Used for data integration
- Pipeline solution to schedule data-driven workflows.
  - Typically a pipeline is:
    - *Connect & Collect* / *Ingest*
    - *Store*: E.g. Azure Store
    - *Transform & Enrich*
      - Process in Spark, Data Lake Analytics and Machine Learning.
      - *Prep & train* with **Azure Databricks**.
    - *Publish*
      - Load into analytics engine (e.g. Azure SQL database) to be used by BI tools.
    - *Monitor*
      - Check failure/success rates
- Handles
  - Extract-transfer-load
  - Data integration
    - Can ingest data from data stores.
    - Send output data to data stores.
    - E.g. file shares, FTP web, databases, SaaS services.
  - Hybrid extract-transfer-load
