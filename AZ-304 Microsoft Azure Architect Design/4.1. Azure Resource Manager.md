# Azure Resource Manager

- Designed to represent each service in Azure as a resource provider and each service instance in Azure as a modular resource.
- JSON templates are used to deploy collections of resources using Infrastructure-as-Code concepts.
- You can interact with Resource Manager using PowerShell, CLI, Client libraries, Visual Studio, Portal, REST API.

## Resource groups

- Common lifecycle for resources: They can be created, managed, monitored, or deleted together.
- The Resource Manager also offers the concept of resource group templates
  - You define a service unit in advance, and then use the template to create as many resource groups as you need.

## Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Objects

- 💡 Envision your solution using ARM
  - Start by designing and conceptualizing your entire solution considering all components that may compose your solution.
  - Then identify individual units of functionality and find resources available on Azure that can facilitate the specific functionalities.
- **Resource** : Single service. E.g. web app, app service plan, SQL database.
- **Resource group** : Logical grouping of resources.
- **Resource group template** : JSON file that describes a set of resources.

## ARM Templates

- Some or all of the properties of the resource can be parameterized so that you can customize your deployment by providing parameter values at deployment time.
- Deployment
  - ARM Templates are deployed in a few ways.
    - These depend on your aims, the result intended and your chosen method for development.
  - A ***developer*** may choose to use Visual Studio to create and deploy ARM templates directly and to manage the lifecycle of the resources through Visual Studio.
  - An ***administrator*** may choose to use PowerShell or the Azure Command Line to deploy resources and amend them.
  - An ***end user*** without command line or developer skills would choose to use the Azure Portal to deploy resources without realizing a template is involved. E.g. marketplace offerings.
- Advantages:
  - ***Ensure idempotency*** : Identical template to multiple resource => same functionality.
  - ***Simplify orchestration*** : Automatize.
  - ***Configure multiple resources** : Order, fix dependencies.
  - ***Parameterize*** : Define input & input for reuse. Can be nested for larger orchestration.
- Template resources: Parameters *(=> Variables )* => Resources => Output

### JSON schema

- 📝 Empty ARM template:

  ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
      "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
      "parameters": { },
      "variables": { },
      "resources": [ ],
      "outputs": { }
    }
  ```

- Required: `content`, `resources`
- Optional: `parameters`, `variables`, `output`.
