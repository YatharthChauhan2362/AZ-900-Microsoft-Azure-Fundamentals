# VM Availability

- Microsoft Azure provides a Service Level Agreement (SLA)
  - backed by a financial service credit payment for IaaS Virtual Machines.
  - Depends on the deployment of the virtual machine and what resources it uses.

## Availability Set

- Ensures SLA can be provided.
  - One VM being available at least 99.95% of the time.
- Ensures VMs you deploy within an Azure data center are isolated from each other.
- Ensures that all virtual machines that are added to the set are placed in such a way as to ensure that neither hardware faults or Azure fabric updates that is unplanned and planned maintenance events can bring down all of the virtual machines.
- Application availability can be impacted by:
  - Unplanned hardware maintenance event
  - An unexpected downtime
  - Planned maintenance events
- üí° To reduce or remove the impact of downtime:
  - Place virtual machines in an availability set for redundancy.
  - Use managed disks for all VMs placed in an availability set.
  - Use Scheduled Events to respond to events.
  - Place each tier of your application in a separate availability set.
  - Use a load balancer in combination with availability sets.
- üí° Avoid single instance VMs in an availability set.
  - They are subject to any SLA unless all the Operating System and Data disks are using Premium storage.

### Update and Fault Domains

- Each machine in the Availability set is placed in an Update Domain and a Fault domain.
- A **Fault Domain (FD)** is essentially a rack of servers.
  - It consumes subsystems like network, power, cooling etc.
- **Update Domain (UD)**
  - Purposeful move to take down one (or more) of your servers.
  - It will walk through your update domains one after the other.
- üìù FDs come in sets of 2 and UDs come in sets of 5 (default)
  - So if you deploy more than 5 VMs in an availability set they'll end up in same UD and FD.

### Multiple availability sets

- E.g. N-tier availability sets
  - An extension of the availability set model is used logically to place individual tiers of an application into separate Availability Sets.
  - E.g. put front-ends in one, and data tier in another availability set.

## Availability Zones

- Advent of a data center-wide fault would prevent the Availability set from functioning.
- Allows for a complete data center failure and keep your VM based application running.
  - Zone = separate zone or building within a single Azure region.
- You can set the count of zones while creating VM.
  - There is a maximum of three Availability Zones per supported Azure region.
  - Each Zone operates on an entirely isolated power source, cooling system, and network infrastructure.
