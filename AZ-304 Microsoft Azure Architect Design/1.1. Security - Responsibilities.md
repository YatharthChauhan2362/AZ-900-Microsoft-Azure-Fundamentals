# Responsibilities

- Microsoft gives you a secure foundation & tooling to control your environment but customers have the responsibility of their subscription governance, data, identities, and how to protect those.
- The cloud presents a spectrum of responsibilities based on what types of services and/or features a customer may be consuming.
  - This is unlike more traditional on-premises information systems where most, if not all, security is implemented by the same owner.
  - In IaaS , customer owns more control than in PaaS or SaaS.
- The subscription is associated with a Microsoft account or organizational account.
