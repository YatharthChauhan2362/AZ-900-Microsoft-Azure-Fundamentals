## Workbooks

- Interactive dashboards
- There are gallery of workbooks
  - E.g. nice graphs for insecure protocols (LDAP, SMB, Kerberos...)
- You can also create your own workbooks using queries
- Can be exported/imported as JSON file, called Gallery Template
- üëÄ See [Workbooks | Azure/Azure-Sentinel (GitHub)](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Workbooks) for workbook examples

## Analytics rules

- Also known as **detection rules**
- Can be
  - built-in: there are already many
  - or custom: with custom triggers, periodicity etc.
- Each rule triggers an alert based on a condition
  - When an alert is generated it can run [playbook](#playbooks)
  - or *automation rules* that can tag, assign, or run a [playbook](#playbooks)
- Can enable [User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)](#user-and-entity-behavior-analytics-ueba)
  - Can map query results to entities e.g. a malware or a security group
- Optionally creates [incidents](#incidents)
- Each rule can have tactics
  - Used to help with filtering rules and classification
  - [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework
- Built-in rules has different alert types
- Uses Kusto Query Language (KQL) as query language
- üëÄ See [Azure/Azure-Sentinel |¬†GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel) for query examples

### Rules alert types

- **Microsoft security** (can be custom)
  - Creates incidents every time an alert is triggered in a connected Microsoft security solution
  - E.g. Microsoft Cloud App Security, Microsoft Defender for Identity
- **[Fusion](#azure-sentinel-fusion)** (built-in only)
  - Uses machine learning to correlate low-fidelity events
  - E.g. "mass file download following suspicious Azure AD sign-in", [see more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/fusion)
- **Machine learning behavioral analytics** (built-in only)
  - Based on proprietary Microsoft machine learning algorithms
- **Scheduled** (can be custom)
  - Based on built-in queries written by Microsoft security experts
  - E.g. "Malware in the recycle bin"
- üëÄ Read more: [Detect threats out-of-the-box |¬†Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/tutorial-detect-threats-built-in)

### Automatic URL detonation

- Enrich alerts with screenshots (e.g. for phishing sites), verdicts, final URLs
- Query results can map to a new URL entity type
- Can configure URL entities in [analytics rules](#analytics-rules)

### User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)

- Detect any anomalous behavior of users and entities by profiling them
- Entities include non-user accounts e.g. computers, services etc.
- Can detect e.g. ‚Ä¢¬†abuse of privileged identities ‚Ä¢ compromised user and entities ‚Ä¢ insider threats ‚Ä¢ data exfiltration
- E.g. if user downloads 10 MB per day and downloads many GBs it would trigger an alert
- Data sources include: ‚Ä¢ Audit logs ‚Ä¢ Azure activity ‚Ä¢ Security events ‚Ä¢ Signing logs
- Used by both Azure Sentinel and Defender for Identity"¬®
- Enabled and data is stored inside Sentinel workspace
  - No data is saved in [Log Analytics workspace](./3.7.%20Monitoring.md#log-analytics-workspace)

## Hunting

### Queries

- Run built-in queries or own queries with KQL
- You can save queries to run later
- You can add tags
- **Azure Sentinel bookmarks**
  - You can tag and bookmark query results
  - Allows you to investigate using investigation map
- **Azure Sentinel livestreams**
  - Allows you to
    - test queries without conflicting with existing [rules](#analytics-rules)
    - get notified when it hits without creating a rule [rules](#analytics-rules)
    - add queries to livestreams to run them later or in a scheduled manner.
    - investigate them
  - üí° Good to start with creating livestreams and if queries work promote them to creating rules.

### Azure Sentinel Notebooks

- Integrates Jupyter notebooks for hunting using an indeterminate component
  - Charged for notebook compute + storage
- Can also save data as HTML/JSON
- ‚ùóÔ∏è Requires Azure Machine Learning workspace
- üëÄ See [GitHub page (Azure/Azure-Sentinel-Notebooks)](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel-Notebooks) for open-source library of samples

### Investigation graph

- Also known as **investigation map**
- Allows you to investigate entity relationships in [incidents](#incidents)
- Displays entity relationships extracted automatically from the raw data
- Requires using "entity mapping fields" in [analytics rules](#analytics-rules)
- ![Azure Sentinel Investigation Graph / Investigation map](./img/sentinel-investigation-map.png)

## Playbooks

- Helps to automate and integrate across tools
- Can be triggered from an alert or incident investigation
- Can be used for e.g.
  - incident management: to open a ticket in JIRA/service now
  - enrich investigation: ‚Ä¢ GeoIP lookups
  - remediation: ‚Ä¢ block IP address/user access ‚Ä¢ isolate machine ‚Ä¢ trigger conditional access
- üëÄ See [GitHub page](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Playbooks) for open-source library of samples
- Done using Logic apps + APIs

## Incidents

  - track and change its status (new, done etc.)
  - add bookmarks, tags and comments
  - investigate in "Defender for Endpoint"
    - Shows data connected to Sentinel
    - Also collects data in [Log Analytics Workspace](./3.7.%20Monitoring.md#log-analytics-workspace)
  - can execute playbooks for automating stuff like
    - integrating with a ticketing system using logic app
    - automatically assigning an incident to someone when it's created
  - can be investigated using [investigation graphs](#investigation-graph)

## Machine learning

- Can use built-in models or bring your own models
- E.g. [anomalous RDP detection](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/what-s-new-azure-sentinel-machine-learning-behavior-analytics/ba-p/1521988) for unusual IP/geolocation or new user

### Onboarding Azure Sentinel

- Prerequisites
  - [Log analytics workspace](./3.7.%20Monitoring.md#log-analytics-workspace)
- Steps
  1. Enable Azure Sentinel
     - Done by connecting Azure Sentinel into an existing [Log analytics workspace](./3.7.%20Monitoring.md#log-analytics-workspace)
     - ‚ùó Once enabled, workspace cannot be moved to other resource groups or subscriptions.
  2. Connect your [data sources](#data-sources)
     - Steps: Main menu -> Data connectors -> Open connector page
  3. Set up [threat detection rules](#analytics-rules)
- üëÄ See also: [Quickstart: On-board Azure Sentinel |¬†Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/quickstart-onboard?WT.mc_id=thomasmaurer-blog-thmaure)
